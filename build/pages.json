IIIF, along with a wide range of freely available [IIIF compliant software|https://iiif.io/apps-demos/], represents a flexible, standard approach to providing reliable access to such images. However, though well described, setting up and re-using such IIIF resources can still be complex, particularly for smaller institutions or individual researchers. Also, a better understanding of how to combine IIIF resources across multiple institutions and present a National Collection, to diverse audiences, is needed.</p><p>This project aims to demonstrate the opportunities and benefits that IIIF offers, to a wide audience of users and help to define more robust use cases of IIIF, for institutions, but also for individual researchers who want to re-use and exploit IIIF resources to carry out new research, create new opportunities and tell alternative stories. This work will highlight existing software and resources and identify what new tools, services or training might be required to maximise the potential of IIIF within the heritage community.</p><p>This will be achieved through a series of targeted workshops and surveys, along with the creation of pilot demonstrators, to provide tangible examples of what can be achieved. This process will involve both technical and non-technical researchers in collaboratively building resources, to increase mutual understanding of the possibilities and requirements.</p>",

As our ability to capture higher resolution images and delve beyond the surface of the canvas has improved -allowing us to examine paint layers, explore under-drawing, and employ X-rays, infra-red spectroscopy, and multispectral imaging to understand the methods production and the subsequent histories of complex cultural heritage objects - so has our need to contextualise these samples, present them to our audiences, and use them for conservation and research.</p><p> Image Registration, simply put, is the process of aligning one image on top of another one, yet the process of doing so is remarkably complex. Arising out of the first Practical Applications of IIIF [Webinar|https://tanc-ahrc.github.io/IIIF-TNC/webinar01.html], and a subsequent call as part of the IIIF Museums Community Group in the beginning of May, it was decided that we needed a dedicated time to discuss not only how Image Registration is currently being employed across various sectors, but also share some recommendations and effective practices, as well as consider the ways in which Image Registration is evolving and how it may be accomplished in the future.</p><p>To this end, we've invited panellists to share their expertise in what we hope shall be a lively and informative conversation in which participants from the audience are encouraged to actively participate.</p><h2>Presentations</h2>[##]",

To the right is his close friend, Georges de Selve, Bishop of Lavaur. This portrait was painted at a time of religious upheaval in Europe. Although the pope had refused to annull Henry VIII, King of England’s marriage to Catherine of Aragon which resulted in a break with the Roman Catholic Church, in 1533 he married Anne Boleyn. The array of objects on the table seem to allude to discord; the arithmetic book, for example, is open at the page concerning mathematical division.</p><p> The portrait is a supreme display of Holbein’s skill in composing images and in manipulating oil paint to recreate a variety of textures. If viewed from a particular angle the elongated shape between the men’s feet becomes a skull. Equally hidden at the top left of the picture is a crucifix that hints at the hope of redemption in the resurrected Christ (text courtesy of the National Gallery).<p>An in-depth analysis of this painting is available on [The National Gallery Website|https:\/\/www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/hans-holbein-the-younger-the-ambassadors\/].</p><h2>Viewer</h2>[##]<p>  </p><p>  </p><p>  </p><h2>Further Resources</h2><figure class=\"figure\"><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tanc-ahrc/IIIF-TNC/master/docs/graphics/detail01_cogapp.jpg\" class=\"figure-img img-fluid rounded\" alt=\"Hans Holbein the Younger, Jean de Dinteville and Georges de Selve ('The Ambassadors').\"><figcaption class=\"figure-caption\">[Cogapp | https://www.cogapp.com/]'s Storiiies Editor uses IIIF in order to create curated tours <p> through cultural resources.

	"content": "<h2>About this Painting</h2><p>The art of painting miniatures in watercolour was introduced to England in the 1520s by the Flemish artist Gerard Horenbout. When Hans Holbein came to England from Switzerland in 1532 to work for Henry VIII, he was an established painter in oil on panel. But miniatures had become an established court art and Holbein clearly found it advisable to learn this new watercolour art. <p> In 1539 it became politically necessary for Henry to form an alliance with Protestant Germany and it was suggested that Henry marry one of the daughters of the Duke of Cleves. Henry needed to judge whether to proceed with the marriage treaty and Holbein was despatched to paint Anne and her sister Amelia. When Anne arrived in England, Henry thought her 'nothing so fair as had been reported', but the marriage still took place, in 1540. A few months later Henry decided the alliance was no longer necessary and the marriage was declared null. He designated Anne 'King's sister' and she settled down to life in England. </p><p>The ivory box is difficult to date, but is likely to post-date the miniature. It was turned on a lathe. Paint losses at the edge of the miniature, and the lack of a gold edge line on it, imply that it was trimmed to fit into the box. Such skilled turning of ivory was unknown in England at this date but was common in Germany. It could have been made by a German ivory turner, either in Britain or on the Continent. Collections of virtuoso turned ivories were being formed in Dresden and Munich at the time. However the box probably dates from the late sixteenth century, and as such is one of the earliest and most important post-medieval ivories in the collection.</p><p>More information about this object is available on [The V&A Website|https:\/\/collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O18966/portrait-miniature-of-anne-of-portrait-miniature-hans-holbein/\/].</p><h2>Viewer</h2>[##]",

It is night, and the room is lit by a single candle that burns behind a large rounded glass containing a diseased human skull. A white cockatoo has been placed in a glass container from which the air is being pumped to create a vacuum.

After its rediscovery in the 1930s, the painting underwent several phases of restoration. Saint George and the dragon were added to cover a large area of damage, as was the monster in the lake, and the ‘hermit’ in the cave on the right was extensively repainted.

He grew it in 1510 as a token of mortification while recovering from a serious illness brought on by the loss of Bologna to the French, and vowed not to shave it off until French troops had been expelled from Italy, which happened in 1512. Julius was a great patron of the arts, commissioning Raphael to decorate the papal apartments in the Vatican and ordering the rebuilding of St Peter’s in Rome. The two golden acorns on the Pope’s chair allude to his family name, della Rovere (rovere is Italian for oak). The portrait was displayed on 12 December 1513, after Julius’s death, in the Roman church of Santa Maria del Popolo. It was enormously influential and became the model for ecclesiastical portraiture over the following 200 years.</p><p>An in-depth analysis of this painting is available on [The National Gallery Website|https:\/\/www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/raphael-portrait-of-pope-julius-ii\/].</p><p><b>Connection to last week's item:</b> Last week's artist, Giorgione, died of the plauge in the autumn of 1510 as attested in an exchange of letters between Isabella d'Este, wife of Francesco II Gonzaga, marchese of Mantua and her Venetian agent, Taddeo Albano.

	"content": "<h2>About this Painting</h2><p>The Raphael Cartoons are designs for tapestries and were commissioned from Raphael by Pope Leo X (reg. 1513-21) shortly after his election in 1513. The tapestries were intended to hang in the Sistine Chapel in Rome, built by one of Leo's predecessors Pope Sixtus IV (reg. 1471-84). The Chapel was primarily intended for the use of the Pope and the body of clergy and Laity immediately surrounding him. The decoration of the chapel under Sixtus addressed the lives of Moses and Christ. The tapestries continued this theme, illustrating scenes from the lives of St. Peter and St. Paul who were seen as the founders of the Christian Church, and reinforcing the legitimity of the Pope's authority and power. The resulting tapestries had in addition woven borders showing scenes from Leo's life and from the lives of Saint Paul, also designed by Raphael: the cartoons for these have not survived.</p><p>In this cartoon Christ tells Peter to cast his net into the water whereupon he and his fellow apostles make a miraculous catch. The story refers to Peter's role as 'fisher of men', who converts others to Christianity. It also demonstrates his humility as he kneels before Christ to acknowledge His divinity, and confess his own sinfulness.</p><p>Simon, wearing a blue tunic, is kneeling before Christ. He has been fishing unsuccessfully on the Lake of Gennesaret in the Sea of Galilee. Jesus tells him to cast his nets into deep water, which produces such a large catch that the boat overflows with fish. Simon exclaims that he is unworthy of such a miracle. Jesus raises his hand in blessing and replies, 'Fear not; from henceforth thou shalt catch men', announcing the role that Simon would now have in helping to spread the Christian faith. The corresponding tapestry was displayed in the Sistine Chapel on St Stephen day, 26 December, 1519. It is probable that Raphael saw it and even supervised its installation in the chapel.</p><p>An in-depth analysis of this and all of the other Raphael Cartoons is available at the [The V&A Website|https:\/\/www.vam.ac.uk/articles/story-of-the-raphael-cartoons/#slideshow=5239394909&slide=0].</p><p><b>Connection to last week's item:</b>This week's item and last week's share an artist, despite being vastly different in terms of their materials, purpose, and size.<h2>Viewer</h2>[##]<p>  </p><p>  </p><p>  </p><p></p><h2>Further Resources</h2><p>  </p><p>  </p><p>  </p><p><h3></h3><figure class=\"figure\"><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tanc-ahrc/IIIF-TNC/master/docs/graphics/Raphael_Registered_Image.JPG\" class=\"figure-img img-fluid rounded\" alt=\"Screenshot of Registered Image of <i>The Miraculous Draught of Fishes</i>.\"></figure><p>The Victoria and Albert Museum has done extensive work to align the various scientific images captured by their photographic and conservation departments and present them simultaneously.

Notes in margin for the illuminator (text courtesy of The British Library).</p><p><b>Connection to last week's item:</b> In Raphael's <i>The Miraculous Draught of Fishes</i> the animals serve as symbols that convey additional, often allegorical, meaning to the biblical scene. For example, the cranes in the foreground are common symbols of papal authority, while the swans and ravens may be a reference to a contemporay proverb about the difficulty in converting sinners, 'one may as well try to make ravens white or swans black'. Similarly, Medieval bestiaries assign allegorical and often biblical associations to various animals. In the case of the fishes, found on folio 68r, the associated text begins: 'They are called fishes (<i>pisces</i>), whence 'flock' (<i>pecus</i>), that is to say, from feeding (<i>pascendo</i>). Therefore they are called reptiles that swim, because they have the appearance and habit of creeping (<i>reptanti</i>). Although they plunge into the depths, yet they 'creep' in swimming, whence David said, <i>So is this great sea, which strecheth wide its arms: there are creeping things without number.</i> (PS 103:23). (Translation Clark, <i>A Medieval Book of Beasts: The Second-family Bestiary</i>, p. 205).

She comes from the great polyptych (multi-panelled altarpiece) which Crivelli painted for the church of the Dominican Order in Ascoli Piceno in the Italian Marche. Catherine was beloved by the Dominicans as a martyr who defended the Christian faith against pagans and heretics. Catherine stands on a marble shelf, rather like a statue. Crivelli has painted her wheel from an acute angle, showing off his skill with foreshortening – a way of distorting objects so that they seem to recede into the picture. Although she lived in the third century, Catherine’s overdress of red and gold figured silk is like those produced in medieval Italy. Her sleeves are decorated with golden pelicans and phoenixes, symbols of Christ’s sacrifice on the Cross and the Resurrection.</p><p>Crivelli painted two altarpieces for the small church of San Domenico, in the town of Ascoli Piceno in the Italian Marche. Their history is complex and intertwined. A large, double-tiered polyptych (a multi-panelled altarpiece) sat on the high altar, while a smaller altarpiece was in a side chapel. In the nineteenth century parts of both altarpieces were sold to a Russian prince, Anatole Demidoff, who mounted them in a grand frame to make a three-tiered altarpiece for the chapel of his villa in Florence.

	"content": "<h2>About this Painting</h2><p>This painting is of a summer landscape in Cézanne’s native Provence in the south of France. Like the Impressionists, Cézanne was interested in depicting the landscape primarily using touches of colour. Although this painting shows Cézanne’s debt to Impressionism, his method is more controlled. For example, he has not sought to spontaneously capture ephemeral, transitory effects of light but has instead used colour to systematically build up the structure of the entire composition while still attending to local detail. He later remarked to the artist and writer Maurice Denis: ‘I wanted to make out of Impressionism something solid and durable like the art of museums.’</p><p>Cézanne created the volume and texture of the large poplar trees here using vertical and oblique brushstrokes of green and blue laid down in parallel formation. The natural forms of the trees contrast with the tauter, more geometric man-made structures in the centre of the picture. The building – possibly a farmhouse – and low stone wall are constructed with broader patches of ochre and blue-grey. Darker outlines define the building’s roof and walls, and Cézanne has also introduced small touches of red. The short brushstrokes used for both the trees and the buildings contrast with the relatively unworked and uniform area of sky and the looser, almost scribbled, strokes of the foreground meadow. Areas of raw canvas are visible along the picture’s right edge.</p><p> This painting, as well as other works by Cézanne in the National Gallery's collection, as analysed by Elisabeth Reissner in \"Ways of Making: Practice and Innovation in Cézanne's Paintings in the National Gallery 2008\" which appeared in <i> The National Gallery Technical Bulletin</i> vol. 29 (2008).

	"content": "<h2>About this Object</h2><p> This eighteenth century engraving by Giovanni Maria Riva depicts Saint Gothard with a roundel at each corner showing the miracles accomplished by the saint during his life. In the top left, a yound man is resuscitated after being drowned; in the top right, a thief is restored to life after being hanged; in the bottom left, Gothard heals the blind and the infirm; in the bottom right, a groom is resuscitated after drowning while leading his horses to water. Born in 960 in Upper Bavaria, Gothard was educated in the monastery school of Niederaltaich and at the court of Archbishop Frederick of Salzburg, Austria. Frederick made him provost of the canons at Niederaltaich, where, already ordained priest, Gothard became a Benedictine monk (990), provost, and abbot (996/997). Emperor Henry II nominated Gothard as successor to Bernward, bishop of Hildesheim in 1022. During his tenure he restored the cathedral, consecrated more than 30 churches, promoted and reformed education, tightened asceticism, founded schools, and established a hospice for the sick and the poor at nearby Sankt Moritz. In 1132 his relics were transferred from the cathedral to a Benedictine monastery in Hildesheim founded in his honour by St. Bernard of Clairvaux.  </p><p> To see this object on The Wellcome Collection website please click [here|https:\/\/wellcomecollection.org/works/k434s8bf].</p><p><b>Connection to last week's item:</b> Cézanne's engraving has the small figure of a hanged man in the upper left corner, in the top right of this engraving Gothard is shown bringing a hanged man back to life.<h2>Viewer</h2>[##]<p>  </p><p>  </p><p>  </p><p></p><h2>",

	"content": "<h2>About this Object</h2><p> <i>The Eidgenössische Chronik</i> [The Federal Chronicle] by Werner Schodoler (1490-1541) is in chronological order the last of the illustrated Swiss Chronicles of the late Middle Ages. It was written by private initiative between 1510 and 1535 and took as its model primarily the Official Bernese Chronicle - Amtliche Berner Chronik - by Diebold Schilling and the Chronicle - Kronica - by Petermann Etterlin. This volume, the third and last of the Chronicle, presents the events of the Burgundian Wars and the Swabian War; it ends with the Italian military campaigns, among others the Battle of Marignano on September 13th and 14th 1515, in which presumably the author himself took part. The volume is illustrated with 196 uncolored pen sketches by an anonymous artist. Today the three volumes are held in different libraries: the first volume is in the Leopold-Sophien-Bibliothek in Überlingen, the second in the City Archives in Bremgarten, and the third in the Cantonal Library of Aargau. The detail this week comes from the final volume and depicts an avalanche on the Gotthard Pass (f. 270v)</p><p> To see a full description of this manuscript on the e-codices website please click [here|https:\/\/www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en/description/kba/Ms-ZF-0018/].</p><p><b>Connection to last week's item:</b> The avalanche depicted here occured in the Gotthard Pass, named for the location the monastery dedicated the saint featured in last week's engraving<h2>Viewer</h2>[##]<p>  </p><p>  </p><p>  </p><p></p><h2>",

	"content": "<h2>About this Object</h2><p>This is the oldest picture in our collection. By [Margarito d‘Arezzo|https:\/\/www.nationalgallery.org.uk/artists/margarito-darezzo], it shows the Virgin Mary seated on a throne with the Christ Child on her lap, enclosed within an almond shape called a mandorla. Around them are eight scenes of the lives of various saints.</p><p>This simple design is striking. The contrast of the gold leaf background with the decorative black borders and the limited use of colour – red, black, brown and gold – makes it clear and easy to read. Its horizontal shape resembles altar frontals, paintings placed in front of the altar table and used before altarpieces placed above the altar became more conventional. However, vertical channels on the reverse of our panel probably once held battens, which were inserted into the altar table to secure it – proving that it sat on top of the altar.</p><p>This depiction of the Virgin and Child stresses that Christ is the embodiment of the Old Testament notion of divine ’wisdom‘ and a spiritual ruler. The carved lions on either side of the throne are intended to bring to mind the throne of the wise Old Testament king, Solomon, described in 1 Kings: 10. In Byzantine art (the art of the Eastern Christian empire), when the Virgin is shown in this frontal pose she is known as the Theotokos (’Mother of God‘). This pose and the inclusion of the throne also reflects a tradition of sculpted images of the Virgin and Child in the West, known as the Mary maiestas (’Mary of Majesty') which emphasised her rank and status as the mother of God. The Virgin wears a crown embedded with jewels, and the strips of jewels that hang down alongside her face recall the type of headdress worn by Byzantine empresses. Christ too is depicted with authority: he looks like a small man, not a baby. He makes a blessing gesture with his right hand and holds a scroll – a reminder that he is the incarnation of logos, the word of God – in his left.</p><p>The scene at the far left of the top row shows the Nativity, followed by Saint John the Evangelist being boiled in a cauldron of oil on the orders of the Roman Emperor Domitian, a torture that he survived. In the following scene, the saint brings a woman named Drusiana back to life. The naked man in the next scene is Saint Benedict, who, having been tempted by beautiful women he saw in Rome, threw himself on the brambles outside his cave in order to overcome his desires.</p><p>The bottom row shows the decapitation of Saint Catherine of Alexandria followed by two miracles of Saint Nicholas. On the left he appears to a group of pilgrims and warns them to throw away the oil that was given to them by a nun – actually the devil in disguise. When they emptied it in the sea it burst into flames. Next, the saint intervenes to save the lives of three innocent men about to be beheaded. In the final scene we see Saint Margaret being swallowed by a dragon and then miraculously bursting out of its stomach, an episode that led to her becoming the patron saint of childbirth. <p>It seems most likely that the picture was made for a church dedicated to either Saint John the Evangelist or Saint Nicholas, possibly the church of Saint Nicholas in Arezzo (Text courtesy of [The National Gallery|https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/margarito-darezzo-the-virgin-and-child-enthroned-with-narrative-scenes]).</p><h2>Viewer:</h2>[##]<p>    </p><p>    </p><p>    </p><h2>Conservation</h2><p> The painting had last been restored in the early 19th century, and during this treatment the old gilding was stripped off the frame and it was re-gilded with fresh new gold, while the border was overpainted with reddish-brown paint. Though this kind of treatment was considered normal for the time, today we would instead value and preserve the original layers. Recently it was decided that the restored frame and overpainted border looked out of keeping with the rest of the painting, and we undertook a conservation treatment to restore these areas of the painting in a more sympathetic way. In the video below Kristina Mandy shows the steps involved in restoring a painting that is over 750-years-old:",
