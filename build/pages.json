IIIF, along with a wide range of freely available [IIIF compliant software|https://iiif.io/apps-demos/], represents a flexible, standard approach to providing reliable access to such images. However, though well described, setting up and re-using such IIIF resources can still be complex, particularly for smaller institutions or individual researchers. Also, a better understanding of how to combine IIIF resources across multiple institutions and present a National Collection, to diverse audiences, is needed.</p><p>This project aims to demonstrate the opportunities and benefits that IIIF offers, to a wide audience of users and help to define more robust use cases of IIIF, for institutions, but also for individual researchers who want to re-use and exploit IIIF resources to carry out new research, create new opportunities and tell alternative stories. This work will highlight existing software and resources and identify what new tools, services or training might be required to maximise the potential of IIIF within the heritage community.</p><p>This will be achieved through a series of targeted workshops and surveys, along with the creation of pilot demonstrators, to provide tangible examples of what can be achieved. This process will involve both technical and non-technical researchers in collaboratively building resources, to increase mutual understanding of the possibilities and requirements.</p>",

As our ability to capture higher resolution images and delve beyond the surface of the canvas has improved -allowing us to examine paint layers, explore under-drawing, and employ X-rays, infra-red spectroscopy, and multispectral imaging to understand the methods production and the subsequent histories of complex cultural heritage objects - so has our need to contextualise these samples, present them to our audiences, and use them for conservation and research.</p><p> Image Registration, simply put, is the process of aligning one image on top of another one, yet the process of doing so is remarkably complex. Arising out of the first Practical Applications of IIIF [Webinar|https://tanc-ahrc.github.io/IIIF-TNC/webinar01.html], and a subsequent call as part of the IIIF Museums Community Group in the beginning of May, it was decided that we needed a dedicated time to discuss not only how Image Registration is currently being employed across various sectors, but also share some recommendations and effective practices, as well as consider the ways in which Image Registration is evolving and how it may be accomplished in the future.</p><p>To this end, we've invited panellists to share their expertise in what we hope shall be a lively and informative conversation in which participants from the audience are encouraged to actively participate.</p><h2>Presentations</h2>[##]",

To the right is his close friend, Georges de Selve, Bishop of Lavaur. This portrait was painted at a time of religious upheaval in Europe. Although the pope had refused to annull Henry VIII, King of England’s marriage to Catherine of Aragon which resulted in a break with the Roman Catholic Church, in 1533 he married Anne Boleyn. The array of objects on the table seem to allude to discord; the arithmetic book, for example, is open at the page concerning mathematical division.</p><p> The portrait is a supreme display of Holbein’s skill in composing images and in manipulating oil paint to recreate a variety of textures. If viewed from a particular angle the elongated shape between the men’s feet becomes a skull. Equally hidden at the top left of the picture is a crucifix that hints at the hope of redemption in the resurrected Christ (text courtesy of the National Gallery).<p>An in-depth analysis of this painting is available on [The National Gallery Website|https:\/\/www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/hans-holbein-the-younger-the-ambassadors\/].</p><h2>Viewer</h2>[##]<p>  </p><p>  </p><p>  </p><h2>Further Resources</h2><figure class=\"figure\"><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tanc-ahrc/IIIF-TNC/master/docs/graphics/detail01_cogapp.jpg\" class=\"figure-img img-fluid rounded\" alt=\"Hans Holbein the Younger, Jean de Dinteville and Georges de Selve ('The Ambassadors').\"><figcaption class=\"figure-caption\">[Cogapp | https://www.cogapp.com/]'s Storiiies Editor uses IIIF in order to create curated tours <p> through cultural resources.

	"content": "<h2>About this Painting</h2><p>The art of painting miniatures in watercolour was introduced to England in the 1520s by the Flemish artist Gerard Horenbout. When Hans Holbein came to England from Switzerland in 1532 to work for Henry VIII, he was an established painter in oil on panel. But miniatures had become an established court art and Holbein clearly found it advisable to learn this new watercolour art. <p> In 1539 it became politically necessary for Henry to form an alliance with Protestant Germany and it was suggested that Henry marry one of the daughters of the Duke of Cleves. Henry needed to judge whether to proceed with the marriage treaty and Holbein was despatched to paint Anne and her sister Amelia. When Anne arrived in England, Henry thought her 'nothing so fair as had been reported', but the marriage still took place, in 1540. A few months later Henry decided the alliance was no longer necessary and the marriage was declared null. He designated Anne 'King's sister' and she settled down to life in England. </p><p>The ivory box is difficult to date, but is likely to post-date the miniature. It was turned on a lathe. Paint losses at the edge of the miniature, and the lack of a gold edge line on it, imply that it was trimmed to fit into the box. Such skilled turning of ivory was unknown in England at this date but was common in Germany. It could have been made by a German ivory turner, either in Britain or on the Continent. Collections of virtuoso turned ivories were being formed in Dresden and Munich at the time. However the box probably dates from the late sixteenth century, and as such is one of the earliest and most important post-medieval ivories in the collection.</p><p>More information about this object is available on [The V&A Website|https:\/\/collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O18966/portrait-miniature-of-anne-of-portrait-miniature-hans-holbein/\/].</p><h2>Viewer</h2>[##]",

He grew it in 1510 as a token of mortification while recovering from a serious illness brought on by the loss of Bologna to the French, and vowed not to shave it off until French troops had been expelled from Italy, which happened in 1512. Julius was a great patron of the arts, commissioning Raphael to decorate the papal apartments in the Vatican and ordering the rebuilding of St Peter’s in Rome. The two golden acorns on the Pope’s chair allude to his family name, della Rovere (rovere is Italian for oak). The portrait was displayed on 12 December 1513, after Julius’s death, in the Roman church of Santa Maria del Popolo. It was enormously influential and became the model for ecclesiastical portraiture over the following 200 years.</p><p>An in-depth analysis of this painting is available on [The National Gallery Website|https:\/\/www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/raphael-portrait-of-pope-julius-ii\/].</p><p><b>Connection to last week's item:</b> Last week's artist, Giorgione, died of the plauge in the autumn of 1510 as attested in an exchange of letters between Isabella d'Este, wife of Francesco II Gonzaga, marchese of Mantua and her Venetian agent, Taddeo Albano.

	"content": "<h2>About this Painting</h2><p>The Raphael Cartoons are designs for tapestries and were commissioned from Raphael by Pope Leo X (reg. 1513-21) shortly after his election in 1513. The tapestries were intended to hang in the Sistine Chapel in Rome, built by one of Leo's predecessors Pope Sixtus IV (reg. 1471-84). The Chapel was primarily intended for the use of the Pope and the body of clergy and Laity immediately surrounding him. The decoration of the chapel under Sixtus addressed the lives of Moses and Christ. The tapestries continued this theme, illustrating scenes from the lives of St. Peter and St. Paul who were seen as the founders of the Christian Church, and reinforcing the legitimity of the Pope's authority and power. The resulting tapestries had in addition woven borders showing scenes from Leo's life and from the lives of Saint Paul, also designed by Raphael: the cartoons for these have not survived.</p><p>In this cartoon Christ tells Peter to cast his net into the water whereupon he and his fellow apostles make a miraculous catch. The story refers to Peter's role as 'fisher of men', who converts others to Christianity. It also demonstrates his humility as he kneels before Christ to acknowledge His divinity, and confess his own sinfulness.</p><p>Simon, wearing a blue tunic, is kneeling before Christ. He has been fishing unsuccessfully on the Lake of Gennesaret in the Sea of Galilee. Jesus tells him to cast his nets into deep water, which produces such a large catch that the boat overflows with fish. Simon exclaims that he is unworthy of such a miracle. Jesus raises his hand in blessing and replies, 'Fear not; from henceforth thou shalt catch men', announcing the role that Simon would now have in helping to spread the Christian faith. The corresponding tapestry was displayed in the Sistine Chapel on St Stephen day, 26 December, 1519. It is probable that Raphael saw it and even supervised its installation in the chapel.</p><p>An in-depth analysis of this and all of the other Raphael Cartoons is available at the [The V&A Website|https:\/\/www.vam.ac.uk/articles/story-of-the-raphael-cartoons/#slideshow=5239394909&slide=0].</p><p><b>Connection to last week's item:</b>This week's item and last week's share an artist, despite being vastly different in terms of their materials, purpose, and size.<h2>Viewer</h2>[##]<p>  </p><p>  </p><p>  </p><p></p><h2>Further Resources</h2><p>  </p><p>  </p><p>  </p><p><h3></h3><figure class=\"figure\"><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tanc-ahrc/IIIF-TNC/master/docs/graphics/Raphael_Registered_Image.JPG\" class=\"figure-img img-fluid rounded\" alt=\"Screenshot of Registered Image of <i>The Miraculous Draught of Fishes</i>.\"></figure><p>The Victoria and Albert Museum has done extensive work to align the various scientific images captured by their photographic and conservation departments and present them simultaneously.

Notes in margin for the illuminator (text courtesy of The British Library).</p><p><b>Connection to last week's item:</b> In Raphael's <i>The Miraculous Draught of Fishes</i> the animals serve as symbols that convey additional, often allegorical, meaning to the biblical scene. For example, the cranes in the foreground are common symbols of papal authority, while the swans and ravens may be a reference to a contemporay proverb about the difficulty in converting sinners, 'one may as well try to make ravens white or swans black'. Similarly, Medieval bestiaries assign allegorical and often biblical associations to various animals. In the case of the fishes, found on folio 68r, the associated text begins: 'They are called fishes (<i>pisces</i>), whence 'flock' (<i>pecus</i>), that is to say, from feeding (<i>pascendo</i>). Therefore they are called reptiles that swim, because they have the appearance and habit of creeping (<i>reptanti</i>). Although they plunge into the depths, yet they 'creep' in swimming, whence David said, <i>So is this great sea, which strecheth wide its arms: there are creeping things without number.</i> (PS 103:23). (Translation Clark, <i>A Medieval Book of Beasts: The Second-family Bestiary</i>, p. 205).

She comes from the great polyptych (multi-panelled altarpiece) which Crivelli painted for the church of the Dominican Order in Ascoli Piceno in the Italian Marche. Catherine was beloved by the Dominicans as a martyr who defended the Christian faith against pagans and heretics. Catherine stands on a marble shelf, rather like a statue. Crivelli has painted her wheel from an acute angle, showing off his skill with foreshortening – a way of distorting objects so that they seem to recede into the picture. Although she lived in the third century, Catherine’s overdress of red and gold figured silk is like those produced in medieval Italy. Her sleeves are decorated with golden pelicans and phoenixes, symbols of Christ’s sacrifice on the Cross and the Resurrection.</p><p>Crivelli painted two altarpieces for the small church of San Domenico, in the town of Ascoli Piceno in the Italian Marche. Their history is complex and intertwined. A large, double-tiered polyptych (a multi-panelled altarpiece) sat on the high altar, while a smaller altarpiece was in a side chapel. In the nineteenth century parts of both altarpieces were sold to a Russian prince, Anatole Demidoff, who mounted them in a grand frame to make a three-tiered altarpiece for the chapel of his villa in Florence.

	"content": "<h2>About this Painting</h2><p>This painting is of a summer landscape in Cézanne’s native Provence in the south of France. Like the Impressionists, Cézanne was interested in depicting the landscape primarily using touches of colour. Although this painting shows Cézanne’s debt to Impressionism, his method is more controlled. For example, he has not sought to spontaneously capture ephemeral, transitory effects of light but has instead used colour to systematically build up the structure of the entire composition while still attending to local detail. He later remarked to the artist and writer Maurice Denis: ‘I wanted to make out of Impressionism something solid and durable like the art of museums.’</p><p>Cézanne created the volume and texture of the large poplar trees here using vertical and oblique brushstrokes of green and blue laid down in parallel formation. The natural forms of the trees contrast with the tauter, more geometric man-made structures in the centre of the picture. The building – possibly a farmhouse – and low stone wall are constructed with broader patches of ochre and blue-grey. Darker outlines define the building’s roof and walls, and Cézanne has also introduced small touches of red. The short brushstrokes used for both the trees and the buildings contrast with the relatively unworked and uniform area of sky and the looser, almost scribbled, strokes of the foreground meadow. Areas of raw canvas are visible along the picture’s right edge.</p><p> This painting, as well as other works by Cézanne in the National Gallery's collection, as analysed by Elisabeth Reissner in \"Ways of Making: Practice and Innovation in Cézanne's Paintings in the National Gallery 2008\" which appeared in <i> The National Gallery Technical Bulletin</i> vol. 29 (2008).

Born in 960 in Upper Bavaria, Gothard was educated in the monastery school of Niederaltaich and at the court of Archbishop Frederick of Salzburg, Austria. Frederick made him provost of the canons at Niederaltaich, where, already ordained priest, Gothard became a Benedictine monk (990), provost, and abbot (996/997). Emperor Henry II nominated Gothard as successor to Bernward, bishop of Hildesheim in 1022. During his tenure he restored the cathedral, consecrated more than 30 churches, promoted and reformed education, tightened asceticism, founded schools, and established a hospice for the sick and the poor at nearby Sankt Moritz. In 1132 his relics were transferred from the cathedral to a Benedictine monastery in Hildesheim founded in his honour by St. Bernard of Clairvaux.  </p><p> To see this object on The Wellcome Collection website please click [here|https:\/\/wellcomecollection.org/works/k434s8bf].</p><p><b>Connection to last week's item:</b> Cézanne's engraving has the small figure of a hanged man in the upper left corner, in the top right of this engraving Gothard is shown bringing a hanged man back to life.<h2>Viewer</h2>[##]<p>  </p><p>  </p><p>  </p><p></p><h2>",

It was written by private initiative between 1510 and 1535 and took as its model primarily the Official Bernese Chronicle - Amtliche Berner Chronik - by Diebold Schilling and the Chronicle - Kronica - by Petermann Etterlin. This volume, the third and last of the Chronicle, presents the events of the Burgundian Wars and the Swabian War; it ends with the Italian military campaigns, among others the Battle of Marignano on September 13th and 14th 1515, in which presumably the author himself took part. The volume is illustrated with 196 uncolored pen sketches by an anonymous artist. Today the three volumes are held in different libraries: the first volume is in the Leopold-Sophien-Bibliothek in Überlingen, the second in the City Archives in Bremgarten, and the third in the Cantonal Library of Aargau.

	"content": "<h2>About this Object</h2><p>This is the oldest picture in our collection. By [Margarito d‘Arezzo|https:\/\/www.nationalgallery.org.uk/artists/margarito-darezzo], it shows the Virgin Mary seated on a throne with the Christ Child on her lap, enclosed within an almond shape called a mandorla. Around them are eight scenes of the lives of various saints.</p><p>This simple design is striking. The contrast of the gold leaf background with the decorative black borders and the limited use of colour – red, black, brown and gold – makes it clear and easy to read. Its horizontal shape resembles altar frontals, paintings placed in front of the altar table and used before altarpieces placed above the altar became more conventional. However, vertical channels on the reverse of our panel probably once held battens, which were inserted into the altar table to secure it – proving that it sat on top of the altar.</p><p>This depiction of the Virgin and Child stresses that Christ is the embodiment of the Old Testament notion of divine ’wisdom‘ and a spiritual ruler. The carved lions on either side of the throne are intended to bring to mind the throne of the wise Old Testament king, Solomon, described in 1 Kings: 10. In Byzantine art (the art of the Eastern Christian empire), when the Virgin is shown in this frontal pose she is known as the Theotokos (’Mother of God‘). This pose and the inclusion of the throne also reflects a tradition of sculpted images of the Virgin and Child in the West, known as the Mary maiestas (’Mary of Majesty') which emphasised her rank and status as the mother of God. The Virgin wears a crown embedded with jewels, and the strips of jewels that hang down alongside her face recall the type of headdress worn by Byzantine empresses. Christ too is depicted with authority: he looks like a small man, not a baby. He makes a blessing gesture with his right hand and holds a scroll – a reminder that he is the incarnation of logos, the word of God – in his left.</p><p>The scene at the far left of the top row shows the Nativity, followed by Saint John the Evangelist being boiled in a cauldron of oil on the orders of the Roman Emperor Domitian, a torture that he survived. In the following scene, the saint brings a woman named Drusiana back to life. The naked man in the next scene is Saint Benedict, who, having been tempted by beautiful women he saw in Rome, threw himself on the brambles outside his cave in order to overcome his desires.</p><p>The bottom row shows the decapitation of Saint Catherine of Alexandria followed by two miracles of Saint Nicholas. On the left he appears to a group of pilgrims and warns them to throw away the oil that was given to them by a nun – actually the devil in disguise. When they emptied it in the sea it burst into flames. Next, the saint intervenes to save the lives of three innocent men about to be beheaded. In the final scene we see Saint Margaret being swallowed by a dragon and then miraculously bursting out of its stomach, an episode that led to her becoming the patron saint of childbirth. <p>It seems most likely that the picture was made for a church dedicated to either Saint John the Evangelist or Saint Nicholas, possibly the church of Saint Nicholas in Arezzo (Text courtesy of [The National Gallery|https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/margarito-darezzo-the-virgin-and-child-enthroned-with-narrative-scenes]).</p><h2>Viewer:</h2>[##]<p>    </p><p>    </p><p>    </p><h2>Conservation</h2><p> The painting had last been restored in the early 19th century, and during this treatment the old gilding was stripped off the frame and it was re-gilded with fresh new gold, while the border was overpainted with reddish-brown paint. Though this kind of treatment was considered normal for the time, today we would instead value and preserve the original layers. Recently it was decided that the restored frame and overpainted border looked out of keeping with the rest of the painting, and we undertook a conservation treatment to restore these areas of the painting in a more sympathetic way.

From 1889 onwards he sent plant specimens to the Paris Museum of Natural History.</p><p>Outside of his missionary and medical work in Tatsienlu, which served as a gateway between China and Tibet, Soulié's main interest was botany and he collected plants with zeal, for example on the peak of Jarra, to the north-west of Tatsienlu. In 1891 he was transferred to Dango, even closer to Tibet, by which time he was fluent in the border dialects, making travelling much easier.</p><p>In order to not attract attention in this politically turbulent region, Soulié disguised himself as a native merchant, and in this way travelled along the course of the Mekong River through part of Tibet, reaching Tseku. He was later transferred to Yaregong, where he earned a good reputation for his medical work.</p><p>In ten years, Soulié collected more than 7,000 specimens from the high altitude Tibetan region and was the last of the great French missionary collectors to work in western China, following on from the likes of Père Armand David and Père Delavay.

	"content": "<h2>About this Object</h2><p>Nominated by the British Library, today's object is the magnificent Sherborne Missal, probably the largest and most lavishly decorated English service book to survive from the Middle Ages. </p><p>A missal is a book that contains all the texts required for celebrating Mass, the central service of the liturgy. Every medieval church and monastic house needed a missal to perform the Mass each day. Yet the Sherborne Missal is exceptional for its deluxe scale and illumination. </p><p>The Sherborne Missal begins with a calendar recording the feast days celebrated throughout the year, followed by the texts that were read and chanted at different masses. As is usual for liturgical books, these are arranged in three sections. The first section is the Temporale, which provides texts for the feasts and holidays that are celebrated on different dates from year to year, such as Easter. Then the prefaces, musical notation and text are provided for the invariable part of the Mass, known as the Ordinary and Canon. The final section is the Sanctorale, which features the readings and prayers for fixed saints’ days throughout the year. Some of the texts in the Sherborne Missal indicate liturgical practices that were local to south-west England. </p><p>The Missal was made for the Benedictine abbey of St Mary’s in Sherborne, Dorset. The abbey’s coat of arms features prominently in the illumination. </p><p>The book was probably commissioned by Robert Bruyning, the abbot of Sherborne from 1385–1415, whose image appears in the manuscript about a hundred times. He is depicted together with Richard Mitford, who was the bishop of Salisbury from 1396–1407, and who is represented eight times. </p><p>The master craftsmen behind the manuscript also feature in the decoration – John Siferwas, the artist, and John Whas, the scribe. </p><p>Illuminated in gold and a wide range of colours, the manuscript contains a wealth of images. As well as including numerous references to Sherborne and its abbot, initials and margins throughout the manuscript are illustrated with biblical subjects designed to draw parallels between the liturgical year and the life of Christ. On the pages that relate to the most important festivals, the pictures and ornament expand to almost entirely fill the page. </p><p>The climax of the illumination is the magnificent full-page picture of the Crucifixion which precedes the text for the Canon, the part of the Mass in which the Eucharist takes place. Here the solemn figure of the crucified Christ – his face delicately modelled with an expression of resigned sadness – is surrounded by a dense crowd of onlookers. In the foreground, the eye is drawn to the swooning Virgin Mary, patroness of Sherborne Abbey.</p><p>One of the most unusual features of the manuscript’s decoration is the inclusion of 44 highly naturalistic depictions of birds in the margins. Most of the birds are identified by their Middle English names such as the easily recognisable ‘ganett’, ‘moorhen’, ‘stork’, and ‘comerant’, as well as some that are harder to identify, for example the ‘wodewale’ (woodpecker) and the ‘roddoke’ (robin) – Text courtesy of the British Library.[@@https://www.bl.uk/collection-items/sherborne-missal]<h2>Viewer:[##]</h2></p>    <p></p>    <p></p>    <p><h2>A Slow-Looking Journey:</h2></p><p>The BBC’s <i>Moving Pictures</i>radio programme devotes a thirty-minute episode to a single artwork in which the listener is invited to look at a high-resolution image to follow along with the experts.

	"title": "<i>The Tomb of Cecilia Metella</i>",
	"content": "<h2>About this Object</h2><p>The Tomb of Cecilia Metella on the Via Appia in Rome was probably built around 30-20 BC. This prominent location, on one of the most important roads connecting Rome to the south of Italy, became a site for monumental tombs of the ancient Roman elite. The inscription on the tomb, also visible on this hardstone picture, reads as follows: CAECILIAE / Q. CRETICI F. / METELLAE CRASSI, or \"To Caecilia Metella, daughter of Quintus Creticus, [and wife] of Crassus\". She was the daughter of Quintus Creticus, an important political figure, and the wife of Marcus Licinius Crassus. It is generally agreed that the tomb was likely commissioned by her son. Although little else is known about her, the scale and significance of her tomb suggest she was an established member of the social elite.</p><p>The site of this tomb was carefully chosen for its prime location with many passers-by and also its high elevation which ensured the building could be viewed from afar. Due to this advantageous position, the site was much desired by nobility and church alike. In the 1300s, Pope Bonifacio VIII donated it to his family, the Caetani. They strategically used it as a fortress from which they levied a tax on merchants who passed along the road, creating a toll road.</p><p> One of the most celebrated Roman archaeological sites, the tomb is also known as the Capo di Bove because of the frieze of stylised ox skulls (called bucrania), running beneath the battlements.</p><p>This panel is based on a painting by Ferdinando Partini, who, between 1794-1797, was instructed to prepare six views of the monuments of Rome by Luigi Siries (director of the Opificio delle Pietre Dure, Florence). These were commissioned for a pietre dure room, to be installed in the Palazzo Pitti for the Grand Duke of Tuscany, Ferdinando III. </p><p> With the exception of the first panel, under Siries direction, the designs for the other five landscape views, including the composition, architecture, coat-of-arms and frieze decorating the tomb, were largely taken from etchings by Giambattista Piranesi of 1762. Compare the finished pietre dure panel to Piranesi's etching (courtesy of Yale University) in the viewer below. The first two paintings Partini delivered were the View of the Pantheon (1794) and the Tomb of Cecilia Metella (1795). Two others followed, the View of the Temple of Peace (1796) and the Arch of Janus (1798).</p><p> Four of the paintings were completed in pietre dure – the View of the Pantheon and the Tomb of Cecilia Metella were both completed by the autumn of 1797. However, the arrival of Napoleon’s troops in Florence in 1799 halted production on the rest of the series, which was left incomplete. Both of these panels were seized by Napoleon’s troops from the Palazzo Pitti where they were displayed and taken back to France. After the fall of Napoleon’s empire in 1815, they were returned to the Palazzo Pitti in Florence.</p><p> In 1857, the Tomb of Cecilia Metella was presented as a gift by Leopold II to Pope Pius IX during a papal visit to the Palazzo Pitti. This later came up for sale and was subsequently acquired by Sir Arthur Gilbert. In 1857, a copy of this one was commissioned to be presented at the International Exhibition in London in 1862. It missed this deadline and was instead presented at a later exhibition, probably the 1867 Paris Exhibition instead. This second version is now kept in the Museo dell’Opificio delle Pietre Dure in Florence.</p><p>Sir Arthur Gilbert and his wife Rosalinde, fascinated by the evolution of pietre dure and purposefully acquired 16th-century masterpieces as well as 20th-century creations, and formed one of the world's great decorative art collections, including silver, mosaics, enamelled portrait miniatures and gold boxes. He donated his extraordinary collection to Britain in 1996.

This plaque, which is composed almost entirely of jaspers, is an excellent example of the versatility of this stone. Some jaspers used are from different parts of what was once the Holy Roman Empire, precisely from its western borders (South Baden) and from the Kozakov mountains in the East. Sunlight is shown by using bright and darker jaspers and flints on the tomb, while the peasants’ costumes include vibrant lapis lazuli.</p><p>The sky is made of a very thin panel of transparent calcite stone, referred to by ancient stone workshops as ‘alabaster’. The name ‘alabaster’ is commonly used, yet deceptively confusing for its definition differs depending on the field of study and attributed to a group of look-alike stones. For geologists, alabaster is a type of fine-grained massive gypsum. Archaeologists and stone workshops use ‘alabaster’ for both this type of gypsum and a type of fine-grained banded calcite. To complicate further, the calcite type – the material used on this panel – was described by ancient workshops as ‘Egyptian Alabaster’ or ‘Oriental Alabaster’ for its evident provenance from Egypt. On the other hand, modern workshops sometimes call it ‘onyx-marble’ for its banded appearance, which is similar to onyx and marble, even though they are completely distinct.</p><p>Click on the V&A's video below to see how pietre dure panels are constructed:</p>",

	"content": "<h2>About this Object</h2><p>One of two major Sanskrit epics of Ancient India, the <i>Mahābhārata</i> tells the tale of a dynastic struggle between two sets of cousins for control of the Bharata kingdom in central India. One of the longest poems ever written, eclipsed only by the Gesar Epic of Tibet, it is said to have been composed between 900 and 400BCE by the sage Vyasa, although, in reality, it is likely to have been created by a number of individuals. To Hindus, it is important in terms of both dharma (moral law) and history (itihasa), as its themes are often didactic. This scroll dates to 1795CE and was donated to Edinburgh University in 1821 by Colonel Walker of Bowland. It is 13.5cm wide and 72m long, all housed in a wooden case, wound around rollers and turned by a key in the side. It has 78 miniatures of varying sizes. All of the illustrations are in the late Mughul or Kangra style, with gold backgrounds and floral patterning in red, white and gold, as well as green leaves and blue diamond-shaped designs. The text itself is dense, tiny, and underpinned with yet more gold leaf decorations.</p><p> Photographically, this represented a series of challenges. In the first place, the length alone meant that many images would need to be taken and subsequently stitched together, preliminary work revealed that close to 475 distinct images would need to be taken and all stitched together generating a single huge image (5 stitched images resulted in a the file size of 400MB in tiff format). While the IIIF integration supports the serving of tiled jpg2000s or pyramidal TIFF files for delivery, the sheer mass of the single image file required considerable processing power for the initial composition.  Added to this, the Victorian housing causes the scroll to sag, and is difficult to keep perfectly steady. In conjunction with conservator Emily Hick, a thin platform was made to be carefully inserted underneath the scroll to provide the necessary stability. Finally, one of the most significant imaging challenges was the gold: each movement causes the light to reflect in a different way, making the stitching of images very slow work.[@@https://libraryblogs.is.ed.ac.uk/diu/2016/05/24/a-lengthy-challenge-photographing-the-mahabharata/]><h2>Viewer:</h2><p>[##]</p>    <p></p>    <p></p>    <p></p><h2>Conservation and Digitisation</h2><p> Though we often talk about the way in which objects were made originally, we very rarely discuss how those physical objects come to be digitally presented online. This is all the more relevant in an object like the <i>Mahābhārata Scroll</i> as, at 78 meters long, it is simply too extensive to even try to capture in a single image, especially to get the level of resolution required to make it a valuable online resource. The video available below, the Mahābhārata Digitisation Project is presented by those involved in the project, from academics, to conservators, photographers, and digital developers.</p>    <p></p><p>In the case of the <i>Mahābhārata Scroll</i> the Digital Imaging Unit from the University of Edinburgh has also given us an insight into their process as Susan Pettigrew and Scott Renton wrote up a discussion of the way in which they eventually captured and stitched together the images and then approached displaying these online.</p>",

He was a close follower of Fra Angelico; according to Vasari he was Angelico's pupil, although there is no documented contact. He is documented mainly as a manuscript illuminator, but he was also a painter of panels. His work is often confused with that of Domenico di Michelino and the Master of the Buckingham Palace Madonna.</p><p>The only surviving signed panel painting is the 'Annunciation' in the National Gallery which bears a concealed signature (ZA / NOBI). Documented panel paintings include a lost altarpiece in the Chapel of St Agnes in Sant'Egidio (Santa Maria Nuova), Florence, and a funerary cross for San Marco, Florence. 'A Virgin and Child with Angels' (Florence, Museo di San Marco) and an 'Annunciation' (Philadelphia, Johnson Collection) are also attributed to him.

The video below, seeks to recapture the soundscape of fifteenth-century Florence through a special collaboration between Cut Circle and Stanford students. Gorgeous visual imagery and discussions of liturgy, book making, and vocal technique are interwoven with full-blooded performances of chant (anchored in the Antiphonal from the parish at Santa Maria sopra Porta), non-notated polyphony, motets, and rowdy carnival songs.[@@ https://cutcircle.org/videos/sounds-of-renaissance-florence/]</p>",

Today, as our eighth instalment in our 500+ Follower Celebration, we’re showcasing the work of Digirati Ltd., represented on the project by Tom Crane and John Baker. As each of the objects in this series has been nominated by the curators or custodians of each institutions’ collection, I asked Digirati which project they would like to showcase and they landed on a collaboration with the Paul Mellon Centre for British Art, <i>The Royal Academy Summer Exhibition: A Chronicle, 1769 – 2018</i>, the first IIIF-based web resource to win a Webby Award, presented by the International Academy of Digital Arts and Sciences and referred to as ‘the Internet’s highest honor’ by The New York Times, in the category of ‘People’s Voice’ for ‘General Websites — Art’. The site went on to further win an Gold Muse Award from the American Alliance of Museums (AAM) in  May, 2019</p></div><p><h2>About the project: </h2><p>Launched on May 30th, 2018 to coincide with the 250th anniversary of the annual exhibition of contemporary art at the Royal Academy<i>The Royal Academy Summer Exhibition: A Chronicle, 1769–2018</i> was produced and published by the Paul Mellon Centre. The RA Chronicle is an open access and peer-reviewed digital publication produced by the Paul Mellon Centre for Studies in British Art. The RA Chronicle comprises two main parts. First of all, it offers a lively and informative year-by-year account of the Summer Exhibition’s remarkable history. This succession of short, illustrated texts, written by more than ninety art historians, curators, artists, and critics, is designed to highlight key issues, works, or artists from a particular year’s display. To provide a broader context for these accounts, each text is accompanied by factual and statistical details, such as attendance and submission figures, relating to that year’s Exhibition. Second, the RA Chronicle publishes a major digital database that makes the catalogues for every single Royal Academy Summer Exhibition available online as fully searchable texts. Together, the two parts of the RA Chronicle will be a permanent research resource for all those interested in the history of the Summer Exhibition.</p><p>Conceived by Mark Hallett, and developed and produced by a team of Paul Mellon Centre staff, working with many partners, including our authors, designers, and reviewers, the <I>RA Chronicle</i> consists of essays examining key artists, artworks, and events from each individual year’s Exhibition are accompanied by 250 completely digitised and searchable copies of the accompanying Exhibition catalogues. Structured as an online art-historical chronicle that focuses on each individual exhibition in turn and discusses something especially interesting about its character or contents, the <i>RA Chronicle</i> is the product of more than ninety scholars, curators, critics, and artists who produced concise essays, of around 1,200 words each, about individual Summer Exhibitions. Some have written one or two—others a few more. In every case, authors have been encouraged to treat their task as something akin to that of writing a lively short story, on a topic of their own choosing. In a small number of cases, we have also worked with film-makers and animators, who have offered their own take on individual displays. A team of three editors - Mark Hallett, Sarah Victoria Turner, and Jessica Feather — each took responsibility for different periods of this 250-year history, as well as writing some entries themselves.</p><p>This project was made possible through digital tools and technologies, all of the texts, data, and digitised catalogues published in the RA Chronicle are available as open-access resources under a Creative Commons licence, indicating that this is a starting point for research, acknowledging that there are many more histories of the Exhibition and its exhibitors that remain to be written. In sum, this repository of original research and primary source material was created to shine new light on British art, its exhibition histories, and its publics, and to encourage further innovative study.</p><p>Explore the full website embedded below, or visit it directly at [https://chonicle250.com| https://chronicle250.com/].</p>    <p></p>    <p></p>",

	"content": "<h2>About this Object</h2><p> This week we're featuring the Sokol Spacesuit made for British astronaut, Helen Sharman, by Zvezda, an organisation created to develop aviation pressure suits and in-flight re-fuelling systems for the USSR's space research programme. Sharman, originally a chemist from Sheffield, became the first British person in space (and the first woman to visit the Soviet-operated Mir space station) in May 1991, aged just 27, after responding to an advert she heard on her car radio which said, ‘Astronaut wanted, no experience necessary’. She was eventually selected from 13,000 applicants, her scientific and language skills making her the ideal candidate to represent the British Juno Mission. Having spent 18 months training in Star City before the launch, Sharman then spent seven days, 21 hours and 13 minutes in space, primarily conducting biological and agricultural experiments.</p><p> Her spacesuit was custom fitted for her by Zvezda, the company who had also made the spacesuit for Yuri Gagarin, the first man in space. The Sokol suit itself was developed after three unsuited cosmonauts asphyxiated on the Soyuz 11 mission in 1971 when their descent module depressurised during the return to Earth. Every cosmonaut now wears one during launch and return from space. It keeps the wearer alive for a number of hours in the event of a cabin depressurisation. Each suit is tailor made to the individual cosmonaut and comprises an inner, airtight ‘bladder’ of rubberised plastic and an outer layer of nylon canvas. There are connecting rings on the lower abdomen for air (cooling) and oxygen supplies and a centrally positioned pressure adjustment valve control on the chest; the pressure gauge is on the left wrist. The helmet and boots are integral with the rest of the suit; the gloves are attached with anodized aluminium bayonet fixings. Today’s Sokol design is little changed from the original.</p><p> Having worn this suit for two hours on the ground to check its fit. Lying back, Sharman tried to read but her arms ached from holding the book for so long.  She wore this suit both during the launch and during the space flight on board the SOYUZ-TM-12 and MIR spacecraft in May 1991. Despite the suit’s cooling systems she sweated 2 litres during the mission launch. Once she could remove the suit, she dried it thoroughly to ensure it would not go mouldy.</p><p><h2>Viewer:</h2></p><p></p><p>In the videos below, you can see footage from Sharman's mission to the MIR Spacestation, and her susequently discussing her spacesuit and training for space with television presenter Dallas Campbell.

The IIIF specifications align with general Web standards that define how all browsers work to enable richer functionality beyond viewing an image or audio/visual files. For images, that means enabling deep zoom, comparison, structure (i.e., for an object such as a book, structure = page order) and annotation. For audio/visual materials, that means being able to deliver complex structures (such as several reels of film that make up a single movie) along with things like captions, transcriptions/translations, annotations, and more.</p><p>IIIF makes these objects work in a consistent way. That enables portability across viewers, the ability to connect and unite materials across institutional boundaries, and more.[@@https://iiif.io/get-started/how-iiif-works/]</p><p>But more than a technical framework or a simple alliance of GLAM organisations, IIIF is really a community of developers, digital humanists, scholars, researchers, curators, and all those interested in shared open content across the web. Before the global pandemic, each year there was a summer conference, a chance for the community to gather as a whole, talk, build, and help one another through the inevitable technical snags and larger implementation questions. While the conferences have continued virtually, the images below speak to the community, and put faces to those who are directly engaged with IIIF from the Vatican Conference in 2017, the Washington DC Conference in 2018, and the Göttingen Conference in 2019, illustrating just how much the community has grown in the last three years.</p><p><figure class=\"figure\"><img src=\"https://github.com/tanc-ahrc/IIIF-TNC/blob/master/docs/graphics/IIIF_Conferences_Combined.jpeg\" class=\"figure-img img-fluid rounded\" alt=\"Group photos from the IIIF Summer Conferences, Vatican (2017), Washington (2018) & Göttingen (2019).\"></figure></p><p>Below, I’ve embedded the recently redesigned IIIF website, available to browse as well at [https://iiif.io| https://iiif.io].</p>",
