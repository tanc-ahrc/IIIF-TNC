IIIF, along with a wide range of freely available [IIIF compliant software|https://iiif.io/apps-demos/], represents a flexible, standard approach to providing reliable access to such images. However, though well described, setting up and re-using such IIIF resources can still be complex, particularly for smaller institutions or individual researchers. Also, a better understanding of how to combine IIIF resources across multiple institutions and present a National Collection, to diverse audiences, is needed.</p><p>This project aims to demonstrate the opportunities and benefits that IIIF offers, to a wide audience of users and help to define more robust use cases of IIIF, for institutions, but also for individual researchers who want to re-use and exploit IIIF resources to carry out new research, create new opportunities and tell alternative stories. This work will highlight existing software and resources and identify what new tools, services or training might be required to maximise the potential of IIIF within the heritage community.</p><p>This will be achieved through a series of targeted workshops and surveys, along with the creation of pilot demonstrators, to provide tangible examples of what can be achieved. This process will involve both technical and non-technical researchers in collaboratively building resources, to increase mutual understanding of the possibilities and requirements.</p>",

As our ability to capture higher resolution images and delve beyond the surface of the canvas has improved -allowing us to examine paint layers, explore under-drawing, and employ X-rays, infra-red spectroscopy, and multispectral imaging to understand the methods production and the subsequent histories of complex cultural heritage objects - so has our need to contextualise these samples, present them to our audiences, and use them for conservation and research.</p><p> Image Registration, simply put, is the process of aligning one image on top of another one, yet the process of doing so is remarkably complex. Arising out of the [first Practical Applications of IIIF Webinar|https://tanc-ahrc.github.io/IIIF-TNC/webinar01.html], and a subsequent call as part of the IIIF Museums Community Group in the beginning of May, it was decided that we needed a dedicated time to discuss not only how Image Registration is currently being employed across various sectors, but also share some recommendations and effective practices, as well as consider the ways in which Image Registration is evolving and how it may be accomplished in the future.</p><p>To this end, we've invited panellists to share their expertise in what we hope shall be a lively and informative conversation in which participants from the audience are encouraged to actively participate.</p><p> Confirmed panellists include: Ryan Baumann (Duke University), Giles Bergel (University of Oxford), Andrew  Bruce (National Gallery, UK), John Cupitt (Imperial College London), John Delaney (National Gallery of Art, USA), Joanne Dyer (British Museum), Rob Erdmann (Rijksmuseum), Adam Gibson (UCL), Catherine Higgitt (National Gallery, UK), Luca Carini (V&A), Maria Villafane (Imperial College London), Keats Webb (Smithsonian Institution), Charles Willard (UCL).</p><h2>Presentations</h2>[##]",

To the right is his close friend, Georges de Selve, Bishop of Lavaur. This portrait was painted at a time of religious upheaval in Europe. Although the pope had refused to annull Henry VIII, King of England’s marriage to Catherine of Aragon which resulted in a break with the Roman Catholic Church, in 1533 he married Anne Boleyn. The array of objects on the table seem to allude to discord; the arithmetic book, for example, is open at the page concerning mathematical division.</p><p> The portrait is a supreme display of Holbein’s skill in composing images and in manipulating oil paint to recreate a variety of textures. If viewed from a particular angle the elongated shape between the men’s feet becomes a skull. Equally hidden at the top left of the picture is a crucifix that hints at the hope of redemption in the resurrected Christ (text courtesy of the National Gallery).<p>An in-depth analysis of this painting is available on [The National Gallery Website|https:\/\/www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/hans-holbein-the-younger-the-ambassadors\/].</p><h2>Viewer</h2>[##]<p>  </p><p>  </p><p>  </p><h2>Further Resources</h2><figure class=\"figure\"><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tanc-ahrc/IIIF-TNC/master/docs/graphics/detail01_cogapp.jpg\" class=\"figure-img img-fluid rounded\" alt=\"Hans Holbein the Younger, Jean de Dinteville and Georges de Selve ('The Ambassadors').\"><figcaption class=\"figure-caption\">[Cogapp | https://www.cogapp.com/]'s Storiiies Editor uses IIIF in order to create curated tours <p> through cultural resources.

	"content": "<h2>About this Painting</h2><p>The art of painting miniatures in watercolour was introduced to England in the 1520s by the Flemish artist Gerard Horenbout. When Hans Holbein came to England from Switzerland in 1532 to work for Henry VIII, he was an established painter in oil on panel. But miniatures had become an established court art and Holbein clearly found it advisable to learn this new watercolour art. <p> In 1539 it became politically necessary for Henry to form an alliance with Protestant Germany and it was suggested that Henry marry one of the daughters of the Duke of Cleves. Henry needed to judge whether to proceed with the marriage treaty and Holbein was despatched to paint Anne and her sister Amelia. When Anne arrived in England, Henry thought her 'nothing so fair as had been reported', but the marriage still took place, in 1540. A few months later Henry decided the alliance was no longer necessary and the marriage was declared null. He designated Anne 'King's sister' and she settled down to life in England. </p><p>The ivory box is difficult to date, but is likely to post-date the miniature. It was turned on a lathe. Paint losses at the edge of the miniature, and the lack of a gold edge line on it, imply that it was trimmed to fit into the box. Such skilled turning of ivory was unknown in England at this date but was common in Germany. It could have been made by a German ivory turner, either in Britain or on the Continent. Collections of virtuoso turned ivories were being formed in Dresden and Munich at the time. However the box probably dates from the late sixteenth century, and as such is one of the earliest and most important post-medieval ivories in the collection.</p><p>More information about this object is available on [The V&A Website|https:\/\/collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O18966/portrait-miniature-of-anne-of-portrait-miniature-hans-holbein/\/].</p><h2>Viewer</h2>[##]",

However, the drawing resembles a painting once in the Lucien Bonaparte Collection in Rome, previously understood as a portrait by Raphael of G.F. Penni. This is one of a series of images considered to tbe both 'by and of Raphael' that were assembled by Prince Consort Albert, the husband of Queen Victoria sometime after 1876.  <p> See this item alone on the [Royal Collection Trust website|https:\/\/albert.rct.uk/collections/raphael-collection/portraits/bust-study-of-a-young-man] or view the album in which it is found [here|https:\/\/albert.rct.uk/collections/raphael-collection/portraits/raphael-collection-portfolio-21].</p> <p><b>Connection to last week's item</b>: Just as last week's item was a compilation of photographs of works of art, this week's object is also a photograph of a work of art.

	"content": "<h2>About this Painting</h2><p>The meaning of this scene is difficult to decipher, largely because the painting is very damaged and many areas are not original. The two foreground figures are genuine and may represent Saint Roch and Gothardus, who tended the plague sore on Saint Roch’s thigh. If this is the case, the picture might have been painted to commemorate relief from the plague in the Veneto in 1504. The sinister little beaked creature emerging from the water also seems to be genuine, although its meaning is unclear. After its rediscovery in the 1930s, the painting underwent several phases of restoration. Saint George and the dragon were added to cover a large area of damage, as was the monster in the lake, and the ‘hermit’ in the cave on the right was extensively repainted. However, the distant landscape with its atmospheric dissolution of light is evidence of Giorgione’s work (text courtesy of the National Gallery).</p><p>An in-depth analysis of this painting is available on [The National Gallery Website|https:\/\/www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/giorgione-il-tramonto-the-sunset\/].</p><p><b>Connection to last week's item:</b>Last week's item was a photograph of a sketch which was thought to be by Giorgione after a painting done by Raphael.

	"content": "<h2>About this Painting</h2><p>This portrait of the careworn Pope Julius II (1443–1513) is usually dated to the one-and-a-half-year period during which he wore a beard. He grew it in 1510 as a token of mortification while recovering from a serious illness brought on by the loss of Bologna to the French, and vowed not to shave it off until French troops had been expelled from Italy, which happened in 1512. Julius was a great patron of the arts, commissioning Raphael to decorate the papal apartments in the Vatican and ordering the rebuilding of St Peter’s in Rome. The two golden acorns on the Pope’s chair allude to his family name, della Rovere (rovere is Italian for oak). The portrait was displayed on 12 December 1513, after Julius’s death, in the Roman church of Santa Maria del Popolo. It was enormously influential and became the model for ecclesiastical portraiture over the following 200 years.</p><p>An in-depth analysis of this painting is available on [The National Gallery Website|https:\/\/www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/raphael-portrait-of-pope-julius-ii\/].</p><p><b>Connection to last week's item:</b> Last week's artist, Giorgione, died of the plauge in the autumn of 1510 as attested in an exchange of letters between Isabella d'Este, wife of Francesco II Gonzaga, marchese of Mantua and her Venetian agent, Taddeo Albano.

As a result of this long-term research and the recent reassessment arising from the Raphael exhibition held in London in 2004/5, there is an extensive body of primary and published material relating to this group of paintings. It is housed in a number of different departments and archives in the Gallery and for the most part has only been available to internal and visiting scholars. The goal of the Mellon Digital Documentation Project, which began in 2007, was to gather and store all of this material, bringing together art-historical, technical and conservation-based information, and to make this valuable resource available over the Internet, to both specialists and the general public.

	"content": "<h2>About this Painting</h2><p>The Raphael Cartoons are designs for tapestries and were commissioned from Raphael by Pope Leo X (reg. 1513-21) shortly after his election in 1513. The tapestries were intended to hang in the Sistine Chapel in Rome, built by one of Leo's predecessors Pope Sixtus IV (reg. 1471-84). The Chapel was primarily intended for the use of the Pope and the body of clergy and Laity immediately surrounding him. The decoration of the chapel under Sixtus addressed the lives of Moses and Christ. The tapestries continued this theme, illustrating scenes from the lives of St. Peter and St. Paul who were seen as the founders of the Christian Church, and reinforcing the legitimity of the Pope's authority and power. The resulting tapestries had in addition woven borders showing scenes from Leo's life and from the lives of Saint Paul, also designed by Raphael: the cartoons for these have not survived.</p><p>In this cartoon Christ tells Peter to cast his net into the water whereupon he and his fellow apostles make a miraculous catch. The story refers to Peter's role as 'fisher of men', who converts others to Christianity. It also demonstrates his humility as he kneels before Christ to acknowledge His divinity, and confess his own sinfulness.</p><p>Simon, wearing a blue tunic, is kneeling before Christ. He has been fishing unsuccessfully on the Lake of Gennesaret in the Sea of Galilee. Jesus tells him to cast his nets into deep water, which produces such a large catch that the boat overflows with fish. Simon exclaims that he is unworthy of such a miracle. Jesus raises his hand in blessing and replies, 'Fear not; from henceforth thou shalt catch men', announcing the role that Simon would now have in helping to spread the Christian faith. The corresponding tapestry was displayed in the Sistine Chapel on St Stephen day, 26 December, 1519. It is probable that Raphael saw it and even supervised its installation in the chapel.</p><p>An in-depth analysis of this and all of the other Raphael Cartoons is available at the [The V&A Website|https:\/\/www.vam.ac.uk/articles/story-of-the-raphael-cartoons/#slideshow=5239394909&slide=0].</p><p><b>Connection to last week's item:</b>This week's item and last week's share an artist, despite being vastly different in terms of their materials, purpose, and size.<h2>Viewer</h2>[##]<p>  </p><p>  </p><p>  </p><p></p><h2>Further Resources</h2><p>  </p><p>  </p><p>  </p><p><h3></h3><figure class=\"figure\"><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tanc-ahrc/IIIF-TNC/master/docs/graphics/Raphael_Registered_Image.JPG\" class=\"figure-img img-fluid rounded\" alt=\"Screenshot of Registered Image of <i>The Miraculous Draught of Fishes</i>.\"></figure><p>The Victoria and Albert Museum has done extensive work to align the various scientific images captured by their photographic and conservation departments and present them simultaneously.

Large initials in blue with red pen-flourishing, or in red with blue pen-flourishing. Rubrics in red. Notes in margin for the illuminator (text courtesy of The British Library).</p><p><b>Connection to last week's item:</b> In Raphael's <i>The Miraculous Draught of Fishes</i> the animals serve as symbols that convey additional, often allegorical, meaning to the biblical scene. For example, the cranes in the foreground are common symbols of papal authority, while the swans and ravens may be a reference to a contemporay proverb about the difficulty in converting sinners, 'one may as well try to make ravens white or swans black'. Similarly, Medieval bestiaries assign allegorical and often biblical associations to various animals. In the case of the fishes, found on folio 68r, the associated text begins: 'They are called fishes (<i>pisces</i>), whence 'flock' (<i>pecus</i>), that is to say, from feeding (<i>pascendo</i>). Therefore they are called reptiles that swim, because they have the appearance and habit of creeping (<i>reptanti</i>). Although they plunge into the depths, yet they 'creep' in swimming, whence David said, <i>So is this great sea, which strecheth wide its arms: there are creeping things without number.</i> (PS 103:23). (Translation Clark, <i>A Medieval Book of Beasts: The Second-family Bestiary</i>, p. 205).
