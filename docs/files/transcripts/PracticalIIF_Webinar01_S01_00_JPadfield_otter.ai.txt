Okay, so, welcome everybody to today's webinar,  showcasing the practical use of IIIF, it is the first webinar of our project, Practical Applications of IIIF is a building block Towards a Digital National Collection, which is part of a larger Rowards the National Collection Program. We will have a series of presentations today in two sessions. The first session is about existing IIIF work that's been done three different areas, which will then be followed by a break, because obviously we don't want to sit here for two and a half hours all in one go, break for 15 minutes, and then we'll have another session of a set of talks about our actual project and the work that we're hoping to do, or we are going to do as the project progresses. Each of the talks will be about sort of 12-15 minutes or so long. The idea is that we'll have a time for questions at the end of each session. But if you can, if you do have burning questions you want to ask as the talks are going on you can drop them into the q&a section, and we'll try and get to them during the question period, I should say that if, as there are quite a lot of you, 187 now, if you all start asking questions, we probably won't be able to answer them all during the actual time allotted, but we'll try and capture them all, and then see if we can answer the questions and put them up on the project website, which you can see the URL (https://tanc-ahrc.github.io/IIIF-TNC/index.html) there on the page in front of you. And then we'll try and answer those questions later on. Okay, so today we are going to have, We had up to, sort of over 330 people actually registered which peaked at 350, so, if we can actually have 200 people who actually connect to the webinar itself that would be really really good today as I said to representing examples of how IIIF is used for public engagement, and then followed by a session of the work, and the planned to work for our actual project. I don't know if you could spot to your cities, I've used the cities of all of the people who have registered and dropped into the IIIF logo there on the right, to sort of show the very wide spread of people with we've got here. So, welcome to you all and thank you very much to those of you from rather different time zones. We have people from right across America, and even some people from Japan and Seoul so thank you very much for attending today. Now, just to begin with, I'm pretty sure most of you will know what IIIF is as you signed up for this webinar to give, just to reiterate, IIIF is the International Image Interoperability Framework. It's an international standard for sharing high resolution images on the web. And that's also extended to audio visual material, and they're also working on 3D, though that's not part of the standard at the moment some very very good work being done, and I wholeheartedly recommend that you have a little look at their website and community as a whole. for IIIF, it's a lot of very good work being done. Now, to give you a very brief idea of how IIIF works very quickly. If we have an instance here where we have the National Gallery, where I work. The, we have an image store and IIIIF Server, within the National Gallery, and an internal IIIF viewer, we can view lots of images now I'll come back to that more in more detail later in full presentation. But if we also have the Yale Center for British Art, who are presenting images and have a IIIF server and actually have a public open Seadragon viewer available for people to explore their images, you can take the IIIF manifest, which is a description, which I'm sure will go through a couple of times today, all the images, and all the metadata required to work with the images and then drop that into a viewer within the National Gallery, so the IIIF standard allows workers within one institution to view and explore images from another institution without actually copying the images so store once to make use of in lots of different places. So that's the general concept very, very briefly, we'll be going over this in a number of the talks today, but just to highlight that. And now obviously at scale, if we think, within our project. If we extend that example to the Portrait Gallery, V&A, the British Library, Science Museum Group, and many others. If we're all sharing things using the same standard. We can actually look at some fairly sizable cross collection and cross domain,

sort of outputs and solutions there, there's a lot of work we can do but you can also look at closed commercial issues for apps and, potentially, as I'm going to talk about later issues you can work on within an institution to make use of your own IIIF resources. Now, our project as a whole, aims to highlight and demonstrate opportunities and benefits of the IIIF standard to examine its potential for Virtually Connecting elections from different organizations, document lists of existing IIIF systems and tools and contribute to the work that's going on in the IIIF Consortium, and identify what additional tools and services might be needed. The digital tools and services will be sort of covered in future webinars. This is the team: several of the team members are here today, myself, Joseph Padfield, I'm the PI of the project, and I work in the National Gallery. The Co-Is on this AHRC funded project also include Torsten Reimer for the British Library Charlotte Bolland from the National Portrait Gallery Melissa Terras from Edinburgh University. And we also have a wide, sort of collection of project partners. Lorna, Tom, Tom. Jamie, Richard, and Glenn so it's from the Royal Botanical Gardens Digirati, V&A, Stanford Library, Science Museum Group, and the IIIF Consortium. There is an interim project, sort of report for our project. that was opened December 2020 And you can actually download that from the IIIF website. Not only that, the Towards a National Collection website. You can get that from there. And that will be available, we'll drop some links into, well I'll drop some links into the chat, after I finish this introduction for those things I've mentioned to you, which is the first webinar, as I said we will be carrying out at least two other main web webinars for this project. The next one will be discussing the potential IIIF services. And the third one developing practical solutions. acutally more practical workshop. We'll also be looking at developing the sort of four demonstrator areas or exploring what work has already been done within the field to answer these issues so specifically creating a dataset of 16th century British portraits, which we'll be talking about later, how we can support publications, looking at working with IIIF manifests, which will be described a lot by Tom later, and exploring new use cases. And in particularly looking at user feedback and user evaluation of the work that we're doing. So, to move on to the session as a whole, I'm going to stop and hand over to Luca for the V&A, who will be talking about the Raphael cartoons, so I will stop sharing Luca. If you want to share your screen.
