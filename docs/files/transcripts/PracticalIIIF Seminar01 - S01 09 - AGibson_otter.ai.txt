Thank you Joe. Hi everybody. Can we go to my first slide please Anne. Yeah, thank you. So this is a couple examples of image registration to talk about which are maybe not the standard examples to highlight some of the different ways you might choose to use image registration. One reason I chose this is that its been on the high points of my academic career, this is where we got the chance to look at some drawings by Leonardo da Vinci, and what I'm showing here I'm flashing between two images: one taken green where you can see the horse of the top, and the other is a flourescence image taken in the ultraviolet, but excluding the source and you're noticing the flourescent light. And that's what you see all the other images and the dog at the bottom. This was just for interest, just for public engagement and viewing. So, they image registration here I did by eye, in Photoshop. When, when, Joe was asking about the how. This is just by Photoshop. And when he was asking, is it good enough? Well, it is good enough because it shows that the horse is there and the bottom one and they're not there on the other. We're not asking for pixel alignment here, just to illustrate the fact that thing that are not visible under the naked eye, and so on. Could I have the next one, please Anne. Thank you. This looks a mess, but I hope you can work out what it is if I explain it. What we've got here is pictures of watercolour drawings of the alderman ofthe City of London, held by the London Metropolitan Archives, and they've got a lot of these images. And they wondered whether there was a standard template that was modified whenever new alderman came in to get his get his, his own picture, or whether they were done bespoke for each new alderman, as he arrived. And so we imaged these things, and, and registered them such that, and then what you see here is one image in green, and another image in red, and when they align, you see the outline in black. And what you can see is that some of the lines are black, which means that they're common to the two images. Others are in green or red, then they're not. So this allows us to look at which parts of the, of the drawing are similar in the two cases. And therefore, which are likely likely to be part of a template. Image registration problem here is quite severe because some of the is not with we've heard thus far about if you're registering a visual image to an x-ray image for example, some of the features might disappear. Here you've got effectively got images, you've got things appearing in the wrong place, you know, his, his hat is different depending on how it's drawn. Here some to some of the features that are appearing, and some of them are appearing in the wrong place, You still want to get some registration for the features that are in common Cerys Jones who did this, and she ended up using a phase contrast of image registration which aligns in the frequency domain, rather than the spatial domain the details. And so again, is this good enough. Well not necessarily wanting or able to get to pixel-precise image registration here but wantsingto know is that and this line is likely to be the same in two point or not. So the alignment is impossible the concise alignment is not quite so quite so important. My last slide, please Anne. And here I've just left you with some references, and then a reminder to me at the bottom, that this. We aren't the only people to be tackling this problem. Certainly, certainly image registration is  a very big deal in medical imagery, where maybe the images are not so high resolution. So we saw the challenges are similar but different, but across science there's a lot of people in image registration trying to solve problems have been solved elsewhere. Thank you.
