Good afternoon, everyone, for those of you that don't know me, my name is Joanne Dyer, I'm a colour scientist at the British Museu,, and my work specialises in the study of colour, colourants, and their sources. I'm trained as a photochemist and vibrational spectroscopist, so my interests, very much lie in the interaction between light and the materials encountered on on painted surfaces, particularly from antiquity and archaeological and historical textiles. My research mostly emphasises the use of non- invasive methods and imaging techniques, and allows them to be looked at and understood in new ways. And I first started working in imaging and image registration in 2011  whilst developing some work, as part of the EU funded-Carisma project, which had an aim to produce guidelines for more standardised acquisition and post-processing of broadband multispectral images in reflectance and in functional use. In essence, markets. So, John Cupitt, who is also here on this panel was working on a workspace which carried out the post-processing of the images, and used methods that he had developed as part of Nip2, an imaging application which I hope we'll talk more about, to register the various images that we acquired so that various post-processing that relied on the use of several registered images can be carried out more easily, the material that inspired  these methods was published in 2013 as part of the outputs of the project, and we're currently in the process of updating it to reflect the changes in the field in the subsequent years. And currently, as we work on taking this work into the realm of 3D, the creations of models acquired on the different wavelengths of light. This topic has become even more pertinent and even more challenging. I'm hoping to bring some questions in the discussion.
