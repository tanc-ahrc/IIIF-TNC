I will put my video back on. Hello. So we have one question in the q&a section at the moment. We have, in response to me. How long did it take to develop. That's often a tricky question because it was, it was built by me over a long time. So, initially we did have internal viewers and presentation systems that didn't use  IIIF, it was before sort of IIIF was was more prevalent, but we just moved to IIIF to avoid the double decker bus problem, as I was the only person who actually knew how to build it all, so we needed to move to more standard systems to make it easier for other people to use and to support in general. So it's tricky to answer as actual sort of sitting down doing nothing else probably months. In reality it was done in little bits over a longer period of time. That's also because there's lots of associated tools for the automatic or semi-automatic renaming of file images and all sorts of other things that have to be developed along with it, which, which makes it a little trickier. Right, we have a question from Kathleen about Exhibit. Andrew, are you able to answer that one? Is there any data on how many people are using Exhibits including creating their own exhibits?

Andrew Wilson  1:36  
Yeah so I think because I forgot to say about Exhibit as it actually is that it was funded by the Esmee Fairbairn foundation as a project specifically for online teaching for this, so we do have to kind of start, I think we're over 700 exhibits have been created as this went live in about August time maybe about 200 and there was our test, test, test, 123 test, what, four or five. So, probably, yeah, there's some hundred registered Exhibits and we do have we do have some internal data at the moment about there this will all be useful. But one of the things that we are looking at future is actually making statistics available to the person who's created the exhibits as well so when we go into their exhibit to edit it, we can see how many people have viewed it  and maybe from where and all of that, as a, as a future development.

All right thank you Andrew. The next question is from Alex. Alex probably, I can start to answer this question but very happy for other people to jump in: If my organization wants to implement IIIF and has collection management systems and linked images on a local server, where do I start? I think a lot of that depends on what sort of skill sets you have in house, or whether you would immediately need to talk to some digital agency or vendor to help you do the work. I personally quite like having an isolated linux server, and just install a IIIF Server, and start to explore and see what you can do. There is a lot of use cases and examples in the IIIF community there's a great list called IIIF also, which gives you examples of many things that have been built which have life. There's also a IIIF cookbook or many IIIF cookbooks that are describing how solutions for small aspects of this problem. But I would say that the first thing you probably want to do is to look at how you're going to get the data together. So if you look at your collections management system to say how I'm going to pull out my collections information. What jobs need to be done to then relate the collections information to the image information, and do you have enough information in your databases or your file names to actually do all of that correlation or is some actually manual data cleaning needed? The next point is to sort of pick your scripting language of choice depending on your skill set or the skill set of the agency you contact to look at trying to parse all of that data together to produce you a clean database that you can then use, or middleware solution to use to present, or create manifests from search engines from presentations. Rrom there there's lots of IIIF solutions for you to select what type of viewer, you might want. Do you want to just present images? Do you want some kind of forms or databases data entry with it? So it's step by step. So the first one is look at your data, how do you get your data out. And what are your solutions for aggregating it together. There are a number of standards you could potentially look at if you want to be more complex work semantic connections among the data, but simple's probably best to begin with. If you can get your data out, you can then look at more work to do that. Once you have an idea of if a lot of work is needed, they may look at collaborations to explore ways of doing that. But yeah, start with your data first, and then move on to the IIIF community and ask questions there about particular solutions, and the IIIF Awesome list, which Tom's dropped in, and cookbooks, which are extremely useful to find solutions. And if you don't have a solution or a cookbook, you can always suggest, on the Slack channel that a cookbook is required to answer my particular question and see who can help you with anyone else in the panel like to add to that.

I could briefly, maybe add to that, Joe, we only integrated our IIIF stack, probably last January or February. The one thing I'll say, probably reiterate what you said, it's quite hard, I was like I've worked in IT for 20 years to get over that first stumbling block of getting it working, is quite difficult. but once you're there, it's really rewarding. And I think the other thing is the infrastructure, you need the background as well. If you're running a IIIF, infrastructure, publicly, I think that's basically where you Joe and your projects maybe comes in, which you'll hear about later on I think, hopefully,

Joe Padfield  6:23  
Yes, as I mentioned that the second webinar in this series is hopefully looking at the services and systems required to do this, and whether what which ones exist already, which ones might need to be developed. And who might be able to provide these solutions and services, so I think that may well be a good webinar for you to come to look at setting up your system in the first place. I hope that answers. So Paul's asked, Can you give us the public URL again. Can you add, which public URL you are wanting. I'm not totally sure exactly exhibit.so, or the data. One, or

not sure if you could drop it into the chat perhaps that might be good data. Okay. Yes, that's the, I will drop it in the chat.

It's interesting what web URLs you just remember off the top of your head and which ones you need to look up. Yeah, that's the beta end point for doing for National Gallery information.

Okay, So we're now five minutes past almost four or five minutes past five. If there are not any other burning questions, I think it probably would be good to break for 15 minutes to allow people to have a cup of tea or a cup of coffee. And we will resume at 20 past five for the next session with some really good talks about our project. Thank you very much for everyone, and we will be back in 15 minutes. Thank you.
