Full screen slide Perfect. Excellent. Hi everyone, my name is Andrew Wilson, University of St. Andrews within our IT services department responsible for all our library and museum systems and applications here at the university. So brief overview of information about university. University of St Andrews is founded in 1413, and it's Scotland's oldest university, and third oldest in UK, we have around 9000 full-time equivalent students, so obviously a relatively small university, but that means that we always preform very well with in person student experience, which is why, kind of, over the last year, the shift to online teacher has been really really, critical for the university to get right. Our collecting has been going on for over 600 years as well. We have over 2 billion photographs, rare books museum objects and archival material. The collections are used quite heavily in teaching across the university, whether that's English or Classics. Medieval History, Biology, even Geology we ship out some rock samples to Geology to look at as well so our collections are used considerably across the university. So with all that happened  last March, we need to pivot quite fast: medium term outlook wasn't looking great. So, basically, last year we had dual delivery of teaching while this semester has basically been all online except for our medical students. So, last March we embarqued on the series of projects actually looking at all aspects of our teaching and figured out actually where the gaps are and how we could actually bring our teaching online. A lot of the problems are, how do you actually replicate the experience of face to face teaching with our objects , theexperience is quite tactile and sensory, and there's no real way to experience that. That's just experience of opening a rare book for the first time, or sniffing a 600 year old manuscript, or looking in detail at a binding down the side of a really old book. So how do you how do you actually try and replicate that online. So, one of the tools we commissioned during our project to look at all aspects of this object based teaching was to develop this software called Exhibit. We developed this with a company called Mnemosyne, who are a consultancy based down in Brighton. I think it Exhibit basically enables our lecturers to create narratives about objects about collection or objects in other collections through IIIF that 'I' is interoperability, after all. The objects could be 2D or 3D. They basically can piece together a story from all these objects and represent them in a different, variety of views. The flip side of that is that students can also create exhibits sets for assignments so for example a lecturer might give an assignment to say pick two items from our collection, and explain and zoom in on them, and add notes and, explain a bit in lots of detail. And one of the sort of side products of this as well, isthere once our refurbished museum opens which is hopefully a few months, we can actually put these exhibits, on to iPads in front of objects that are maybe a glass cases, that people are not allowed to touch, and we could guide, a user, a customer, through looking at various aspects of an object. And so, I totally bottled it, I was too scared to do a live demo. So I'm going to hop over to a video of past Andrew, so hopefully this will work. Please shout, immediately if there's no sound good. 

Hello. Hello future me! This is passed Andrew. I thought I'd do a quick demonstration of Exhibit. So I've already explained really why we created exhibit. It's open and free for everyone to use. You just need to go to exhibit.so Once you're here, you'll get a brief bit of information about exhibit, then if we scroll down you can either create a new one, or you could try a demo one. Or you could just view some ones that we have here as well. So I'll talk through maybe view one, and then I will jump over to

the other side, and show you how to create what are the various ways in which you can start to create one. So, here's a good example here, this one's about Jane Austen. So I'll just load this up. And when it starts up, you get basically a brief intro slide with some metadata that has been added, there is this interesting option to duplicate, So what this will do is enable you to actually take the finished exhibit and create your own version of it. So in GitHub you kind of fork projects it's a bit like that,  you could take something and then add to it and create your own version based on this one here, and all the rest of it is pretty simple. You've got Universal Viewer controls at the bottom this is based on Universal Viewer so you still keep all of the IIIF data about the, the items as well. Then basically you just kind of click through. So, this is a good example because it has lots of different items from lots of different places with with IIIF. So, and this one is a brief description about Jane Austen, and his picture from a book from the Library of Congress, and you can see it kind of zooms in to places. So, this is trying to tell a narrative about Jane Austen and her life. The options in Exhibit allow you to link out to places in case you want to reference things like journal articles or that kind of thing. And you can see we're kind of just going around this particular page here. Some information about how much her signature sold for. Then it's gonna load up another item from a completely different place, so this is for the Bodleian. And you can see this is one of her very earliest written works, that it kind of goes through and there's blockquotes there so it's been quoted.

There's not just sort of manuscripts that kind of thing, obviously you can have photographs so this is from my photographic collection. Sorry. This is where Jane Austen, lived, at what point, And you can kind of just keep on really clicking through here. This is a really interesting one, that it's not just 2D items. So with our teaching, we've actually digitized, a whole heap of, oh sorry, 3D scanned a whole heap of of items from our collection for use in teaching so whether these are mineral samples or archaeology objects, or even maybe more modern objects with 3D scanned these to make them available for Exhibit to be used for teaching purposes so, you know, a lecturer could point to zoom into particular parts of a 3D objects to bring the students' attention to it so let's see.  This is Jane Austen's writing desk, it's a 3D object as you can  move it around, you can zoom in and out. If I click here to the next slide you can see things, and it points to the exact place that you want your audience to actually see, so I can kind of click around and it's sort of zooming around and go to places that will finish with a 3D object. It's going to load up another photograph. So, this is how Exhibit works. It's kind of a sequential list of annotations or to any IIIF items that you want to create a narrative. One other interesting things that we have been working on recently, which isn't finished yet, but it's obvious there is a scrolling-telling so if anyone's ever seen. NYTimes have been doing a great, a lot of art and sort of storytelling. Kinda cool for  scrolling-telling. Basically you have an artwork or something on the right hand side. And then on the left you have the actual text, the annotations. And as you go down, the view at the side, it kind of scrolls in nicely to tell the story that way. And you can do the same with Exhibit. We haven't got an option, fully in the system yet to show this, but the easiest way to do that is if I just go to another exhibit, all we have to do is actually for now is just type 'equals scroll' on the end and it will change from being a sequential or both left to right type of narrative into something that you actually have to scroll down to see. So here's the intro slide, and if I scroll down you can see it is kind of zooms in, it will load up the next item from the list. And in zooms in a bit more there maybe it'll load up a new item, and you can just keep going like that. So that's what the end result looks like, the end result could be embedded that iframe, on a website, or in WordPress or even in our virtual learning environment, people have added that in as well, or they could just be shared as a URL. And I'm going to create a new one. So there's a few ways to create a new one, you can create one from blank from the Exhibit page. So if I just wanted to here. I clicked 'create a new exhibit', it will ask me specific details. I will click the 'I'm not a robot'. And that will create a completely blank exhibit, ready to go. There's obviously no items, we haven't actually imported anything yet. So the way this works is that it can take IIIF manifests, it can take IIIF collection manifests but the first thing we do is copy the manifest, link and paste it into there, and then the items will be added. The other way that you can do it, and this is way this our teaching has used is using our website, as you can actually search for something. So if I search for 'sundial'. There is an option on our website under 'Use this record'. We can then go 'Add to Exhibit' and what this will do is create a creates a exhibit, based on the items that have just been added in. Alternatively, we have a selection system so I can add things to a selection of different baskets. And then once I've got this selection, what I could do is go 'Use this Selection' and go 'Add to Exhibit', and what that does is passes in the collection manifest of all those items into Exhibit ready to go. So I'll use this to create what for now because it's got some items in it, so my, my Exhibit, just fill this in, go 'Create Exhibit'. I do see, we're ready to go to actually create something.

So it automatically adds the first item on, but maybe I do want to actually start with the 3d object so I'm going to choose this new one here. Just select the thing that was added, and then 'add item', and it will load it on the right hand side. And on the left you'll now see that we have this nice little sub annotation box here. The workflow really is zoom, pan, find the page that you want, whatever you want to do with the IIIF item, and then add your annotationa on the left and click the plus button, and then move on to your next one, click the plus button, etc. So, here. Maybe I will just start with a nice a nice, sort of zoomed out there and I'll say 'this is  a swan'. The annotations can do all things like block quotes, and bold, underline, headings, all of that kind of thing, you could have links into URLs, and other sort of replaces. Then, I want to maybe zoom in. So, zoom into here, and you add yor annotation in , I should say, I have no idea about art work or anything, so these are just not going to be very interesting annotations, and then maybe I want to zoom in down here. As mentioned. So so far we've just used that first image that we had here, what you could do is you could click on them to re-edit and it will zoom back to see so let's say I actually need to move that a wee bit there, you can then edit that text as well. You can also rearrange them. So you just click and drag. So maybe the beak, we want to go after that. So, we've got three annotations on that. I'm now going to add something else. So let's add the sundial in. So we want to jump to the sundial there. And it will load up the sundial, you can see you can rotate, zoom, pan, do everything you want with the 3D object. So now we want to maybe say something about this sundial so: 'This is a sundial'. And then we can go, we can kind of zoom in a bit, and we'll say 'It's 4.00 pm', we could cut a zoom around here and let's zoom out a bit. See, I can make these zoom right, and then we could say, I've said that we've got this is about a maybe, you know, we could then go back to the new swan if we wanted to add some new things in, or we could go to a completely different item. So let's just go to it another at the right here. This is a modern painting, still keeps all of the copyright information and attributions because it is just IIIF underneath this, and maybe we could, we could talk a wee bit about this as well, so create a really really quick item here. A quick exhibit, and you can now preview that so if I click 'Preview', It will load it up, and then you could just see click, you can see it's taking everything that I've added in, and it's now got to load up the sundial. And then it's taking the first position and then it zooms in a wee bit, and then it's kind of gone to the top, and then it's gone back down to the stone there. And then we go to our last painting there. So it's about creating a narrative. You don't, you can add other items afterwards, so if I wanted to add in a IIIF  manifest from a completely different place. I could just add it in here. Add click 'Import'. And what that will do is add in something, so if you want to add something afterwards. So if I add that in now. We should see a gorilla skull, so you could then start to do your things with that or if you want to go and add something from the Library of Congree  or anywhere you could just kind of create this narrative like this, finished. You can share,f a couple of options here: This is really cool this is your edit link so you have to keep that safe because that's the way you get back into edit this, or if you just want to show if people choose 'to view' or they copy the link. You could also embed, as I said before, in an iframe, as well. So that's a real quick whirlwind tour of Exhibit. Very happy to get the questions. And also, if anyone wants to give it a go, just go to Exhibit.so, or go to our university, or just collections pages and find something, and add it to an exhibit that way. Correct.
