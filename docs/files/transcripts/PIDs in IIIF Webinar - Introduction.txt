Frances Madden  
infrastructure project. Thank you for starting the recording that I meant to say. Um, so I'm just going to talk through some opening remarks. And the welcome and sorry to connect. Yeah, sorry, Joe, I apologise I just muted you. There was typing noise, apologies. So, um, I'm just doing some short housekeeping announcements, and then we'll get into the main agenda for the day. And where we'll have introductions from all of our panellists who hopefully you can all see or hear with us, and then we'll have two parts to our discussion. The first part, looking at persistent identifiers for content created by end-users in IIIF and then the after a short break, we'll move on to the second part, which is around institutional materials and interplay, I think, and persistent identifiers for those. Standard housekeeping announcements (and because they are so standard, I am going to launch a quick poll for you to do while I'm doing these announcements just to get an idea about who we have with us today, as much as anything). So as has already been mentioned in chat, this event is being recorded, and it will be made available on the Toward the National Collection YouTube channel. And we'll circulate the links to everyone who has registered for the event. And we'd ask you to add any questions that you might have to the q&a box. And please feel free to use the chat for any comments or remarks you'd like to make. And the webinar has been set up so we can take verbal contributions from attendees. So if you would like to say something, if you've got a slightly more extended comment, and during the discussion, please feel free to raise your hand and we can invite you to speak. Um, I wanted to give a quick plug before we got going for some of the kind of parent activities that both the projects who are organising this seminar today are working on. The first is from the Persistent Identifiers project:  we have a survey underway at the moment, which we are very keen to gather as many responses as possible, so if you can complete that, we would really value that we will add the links to the chat shortly. We've also just released a video looking at the value of persistent identifiers in in GLAM collections (gallery, library, archive and museum collections). And the Practical Applications of IIIF project have recently launched a tool called Simple IIIF Discovery, which allows you to search across different collections, and they're keen to gather feedback on that as well. So we'll share some links to those in a second. And I see we've had a good few numbers of people participating in the poll, but it is still ticking up. So I'll just leave it for a couple of seconds more. And so if you can just submit your answers as quickly as possible and then we'll get on to our panellists introductions.

And just give it a second longer.

I should also apologise I don't know if it's been picked up by my microphone, but there seems to be some sort of party going on in the apartment above mine. So apologies for any background noise. Good. I can see shaking your head. So that's good. It's just me that can hear it. Alright, um, okay, we have one more, two more. So I'm going to end the poll now and we can see the results. So hopefully, you can see that. And so it's great. We've got a really nice geographical spread, which is a well across the UK, Europe and North America so that's really nice to see. Lots of different collection types represented too, and we were very interested to know sort of who our attendees were coming from, like whether they would know more by persistent identifiers or IIIF, so it's nice to see that we sort of have an almost equal weight across both. And a lot of IIIF users here as well. So I'll start sharing those. And I will hand over to Rachel Kotarski, who is going to do a quick introduction to yourself and to persistent identifiers as well.

Rachael Kotarski  
Lovely, thank you very much, Frances. So hello, everyone. I'm Rachel Kotowski. I am the PIO on the Persistent Identifiers as IRO infrastructure project funded under Towards the National Collection. Obviously, that's the very lengthy title so we shortened it to heritage PIDs. And our aims are to really look at increasing persistent identifier use across IROs, that's Independent Research Organisations, which is a special category of research organisation in the UK where they're not higher education institutions, but they are able to obtain research funding from UK Government funders, just giving you the background for those of you who out from outside the UK, as we now know that there are a decent number of you on the call. Here at the British Library, we have been working with persistent identifiers for research outputs for quite some time, we were a founding member of DataCite and looking at how you can make data citable as a first class research output. And over the past few years, we've been turning to look at how we can allow for citation and reuse but also monitoring and metrics of reuse of heritage collections as part of that research landscape and research infrastructure. What I really wanted to do very quickly, just so everyone is on the same page about what we mean when we're talking about persistent identifiers for this project, because we have found that there are different interpretations of how you might define an identifier to be persistent. And I just wanted us to be on the same page for that really. So we are talking about identifiers that provides a stable and long-lived link to an object or information about it. So this is not just a kind of status identifier, it has to actually provide services around itself as an identifier. The example that hopefully most of you will be somewhat familiar with are digital object identifiers dois and name identifiers. So I've used an example here, that ISNI. So on this slide, we can see a doi and we can see an ISNI. And the point is that we can add a URL around that identifier so that it actually forms a link to take you to content or metadata. And we really are talking about identifiers that have three specific features: there is actionability, so can we actually turn it into a link that takes you somewhere that gives you information; it should also be globally unique, so wherever you're using it, it should be completely disambiguated with any other identifiers that are out there, and there should be no clashes anywhere globally. But also the persistence item, when we talk about persistence for these identifiers, that actually we can guarantee the actionability, and the global uniqueness of that identifier, for the long term. And that is not something that's done by a technology called magic, but actually, there has to be governance and commitment to maintaining and identifier it and the content it links to, and the fact that it is a clickable link, essentially. So it's, it's about governance, commitment, and having processes in place to actually manage that commitment. So these three features are really important because they allow us to create tools on top of those persistent identifiers. So we can actually support citation, we can enable, enable linked data (because they are links). And there's also a better understanding of what you can do with a persistent identifier if it meets all three of those features. And I mentioned it before, but just to reiterate that we're looking at trying to increase use of persistent identifiers through this project, deliver recommendations on how heritage and GLAM organisations can actually pick up and use them the benefits they get, but also what might need to be in place to take advantage of those benefits as well. So I will leave it here, and hand over to Joe I think. Extra Joe, can you turn your microphone or do I have to

Joe Padfield  
back on. Sorry. Good afternoon. My name is Joe Padfield little slide about me, here is my ORCID to be my persistent ID for myself. If you don't have an ORCID, do go and have a look. I'm a principal scientist at the National Gallery in London. I've been there now for over 20 years, where I've been studying a range of different things, including preventive conservation, colour science, conservation documentation, technical examination of painting, data sharing,  IIIF, and open linked data. I'm currently involved in a number of related projects here, but the main one I want to talk about or I'm supposed to be talking about today is the practical applications of IIIFF. A sister project to the Heritage Pids project that Rachel has just presented, and is part of the towards the National Collection programme. I'm the principal investigator on the practical IIIF. And I'm a Co-I on the Heritage Pids project with Rachel. Now, the Practical Applications of IIIF is a foundation project in the Towards the National Collection project, its interim report is out, you can go and have a look at it and give all lots of detail about the project. But I'm going to be very brief here today, we don't have an awful lot of time, who you can see the people and institutions who are involved in the project.

And we've got a spread of galleries, libraries, and some archives. So it's quite looking at the various applications across different needs for IIIF. Now, the main aims of the project is to highlight and demonstrate opportunities and benefits of the IIIF standard, and what it can offer to a wider audience of researchers and institutions. We want to examine the potential for virtual connect virtually connecting collections from different organisations, documenting list existing IIIF systems or tools or contribute to existing lists, because there are some very nice lists growing of opportunities using this technology, and identify what additional tools and services or training opportunities are available and explore what new ideas might be needed to develop to help maximise potential of the resources that are available. Now, obviously, that can make an awful lot of sense if you know IIIF is, but I will get to that in a second. So the link has been dropped into the chat. We have a project website here, which lists a lot of resources that have been created by the project. So far, we've done a series of webinars and a seminar looking at different applications of the use of IIIF, which stands for the International Image Interoperability Framework. And if you go to the website, you can explore these resources and have a little look at who is currently involved in the project. And the work that we're going to be doing. A lot of these resources are also available on Zenodo. And this is a clickable link to Zenodo, which you can see when the slides are made available. Now, the International Image Interoperability Framework, it's an international open set of standard API's for sharing images and now audio visual content. So if people present and organise their images in following the standards that are out laid, then people can use them all over the world. It's supported by a community of museums, galleries, libraries, universities, and private companies. There's a very strong community behind IIIF. And it's growing all the time. And it comes with a very wide selection of free image servers, free image viewers, and tools. It's designed to allow images to be dynamically displayed together, so from multiple locations without downloading them. So the idea is images are stored in one place, but they can be presented and used in lots of different places. So to give you an idea of how that works. So if you're looking at the National Gallery collection, and the Yale Centre for British Art collection, the National Gallery has an image store and an internal IIIF server. We do have public service as well. But in this case, an internal IIIF server, we have an internal IIIF  viewer called Mirador. And we can look at all of the image resources we have within the National Gallery. So all the images taken by the various different departments studying the collection over the last so many years. Now, the Yale Centre for British Art has also an image store and a IIIF server. And this one, in this case here is public. On their website, you can have a look at the images presented in Open Seadragon. But because their images are presented, there is something called a IIIF manifest. And this is a small text document that describes the details of the server and the images and the licence and the credits and the descriptions of the objects displayed  about the work done by Yale Centre for British Art. Now that manifest is public. Now if you take that public manifest, and you copy it and drop it into the internal viewer within the National Gallery, we can then compare paintings from the Yale Centre for British Art with the National Gallery without downloading the image and it maintains that connection between Yale and the National Gallery. So as you can see here that that sent the image here of Turner's work has dropped into the list of available resources we have within the National Gallery to explore and these two images can be directly compared next to each other. So the tools this tool, Mirador, is a freely available tool. There are lots of tools to serve the images, lots of documentation on IIIF, I recommend if you don't haven't done already to visit their website and explore all the detail because I'm not going to go into the technical details now. But you can see how that all works from start to finish. Now that obviously extends. So if you look at National Gallery and Yale, the National Portrait Gallery, the V&A, the British Library, the Science Museum Group, and on and on and on. If their images are organised, with a locally defined licence, they can then be pushed into multiple other collaborations and aggregators and organisations across the world. The same images can also be published under a closed commercial licence, if required, to produce apps or anything else. But the same images can also be used as the basis of institutional websites or internal documentation. So images are stored once but can be used and digested and exploited multiple times. And that all works because the IIIF standard can be shared and used by multiple people. And I will stop there. Thank you very much.

Frances Madden  
Thanks, Joe. And could I invite Ben and Sarah to and introduce themselves? Sara, would you like to go first?

Sara Brumfield  
Absolutely.

My name is Sara Brumfield. I'm here with Ben Brumfield. Together, we form a consulting group called the Brumfield Labs, Brumfield Labs does a number of different things in this world. First of all, we do IIIF consulting, we're very involved in the IIIF world. We have done a number of workshops and we wrote the IIIF implementation guide, and then kind of layered on on top of that, we are currently working on a Mellon-funded project called the AudiAnnotate project, which takes publicly available audio files, and helps researchers wrap them in IIIF manifests and then apply annotations to them, and publish them on static websites that happen to be hosted on GitHub. However, our most popular and, and what takes up most of our time, is an open source project called From The Page which we also host as a software as a service platform. It's used by archives, libraries, museums, historians, to collaboratively or crowdsource the transcription of generally handwritten historical documents. From The Page how we found ourselves involved in IIIF, Ben's going to talk a lot more about how we use IIIF in From The Page, but I wanted to mention, we have a large number of From The Page users in the United States, but the British Library has used us for Arabic ground truth transcription. The UK National Archives is a customer, they want a lot of projects on From The Page. And the Victoria and Albert Museum uses us for their Deciphering Dickens Project, which if you've never seen a Dickens manuscript, they are fascinating because they are like the most complicated, confusing, overwritten scratched out things that you've ever seen. But this is going to talk a little bit about how we use IIIF and identifiers from kind of more of a vendor and a software that consumes them in perspective.

Ben Brumfield  
So, you know, people use us as part either part of the digitization process, or a post-digitalization valorization process, right. And the second case is one in which IIIF is particularly useful, because if something has already hosted on a digital library collection system that supports IIIF, then those documents can be brought onto the transcription platform really seamlessly, just by copying in a URL. That also provides us with identifiers in the form of IIIF manifests and manifest ad IDS that we percolate through the entire system so that everything that we export can refer back to those identifiers. Many of those are based off of PIDs. Many of them are not. So this is a challenge for us, or part of the digitization process. We run into other issues that we always need to pass a non-IIIF based identifier, along with material that's been uploaded onto our system and expose it, along with the transcriptions, or other user generated content. So sometimes that is a PID, sometimes that is a URI, sometimes that is an internal ID that is not permanent at all. So making sure that that makes its way through a system that is ephemeral is kind of a challenge. And also being able to attach things like ORCIDs to user-created annotations, is also a big piece of our work with the intersection of IIIF and PIDs.

Frances Madden  
Thanks, both of you, and I will hand it over to Andy. Now, if that's okay.

Andy Irving  
Yes, hello. So I'm Andy Irving. And I'm currently a senior architect at the Bodleian Libraries at the University of Oxford. But previous to that, I spent what feels like 100 years at the British Library, where I was also involved in IIIF, and persistent identifiers. So at the British Library, I was involved in making more and more of our content available through IIIF, and exposing and interlinking various persistent identifiers, including ARKs and ISNIs, and so on, and so forth. And now, at the Bodleian, I'm very excited to be able to take over the supply of IIIF infrastructure here and expand kind of the amount of content that we're making available, as well as integrate some persistent identifiers across the estate. So one of the projects that we're currently working on is another Mellon-funded project called Finding Archives and Manuscripts across Oxford's Unique Special collections called FAMOUS, which is a great acronym. But this involves a few pieces of work, but one of the kind of foundational ones is applying persistent identifiers in our cases ARKSs across our catalogue holdings. So things like our EAD or TEI records, and creating a kind of high quality discovery layer based on linked open data, which will hopefully be able to integrate with our IIIF and make available as soon as possible to as many people as possible. So I'm very, very interested in the IIIF and persistent identifiers, and really looking forward to the rest of the discussion today.

Frances Madden  
Thanks, Andy, and Julian on hand over to you now, if that's okay, I think if you had some short presentation as well,

Julien Raemy  
yes, indeed.

Right should be okay by now, I guess. So, Hi everyone, my name is Julien Raemy, and I am a PhD candidate in Digital Humanities at the University of Basel and also work for the data and service, sorry,  Data and Service Centre for the Humanities or DaSCH as a metadata consultant. And I'm going to present so I have a few slides, I'm not going to go into too much detail here, the Archival Resource Key or ARK scheme and how it can be a great fit for IIIF resources. But I'm very biassed, because over the past few years, I've been quite active in the IIIF community but also in the ARK Alliance. So ARKs are meant to be persistent, reliable links for any kind of things with a digital physical abstract. In within the ARK Alliance, we count as about 8.2 billion ARK identifiers that have been assigned over over 850 institutions. But because the ARK system is decentralised, we only count what we know, what is otherwise ARK identifiers. And the community in the ARK alliance has been created to promote and sustain that open infrastructure. So it emerged from a collaboration between the, at first between the California Digital Libraries and DuraSpace which is now LYRASIS. Here you can see the link to go to the main website as well as the Twitter handle. And it looks like this basically you have like kind of information. First you most of times you will find the ARK label. This is a name assigning authority number which you get when you register. And then of course you need to be to be resolved all over the web with say with the name to  thing and then that gets the the object and by itself. What's interesting here is that you will see that one with one code and identifiers example without changing the scheme, you can be either resolved locally with the French national libraries resolver, or through the global name to thing resolver, and there at the end is the landing page on Gallica, which is digital library from the BnF. And for me, the congruence between ARK and IIIF  is the fact that ARK is quite flexible. Thanks, in particular to qualifiers, as that's one piece in the ARK syntax. And here, we have all the talk about manifest. But also, if you have images, you have the so called true-birth image API syntax, either in info.json, so in the information, image information or the image request with region size, rotation, quality, and format. And that kind of information can really be those qualifiers in the ARK sense. So that's kind of syntaxes. And what I can what I think it is also is a great fit as they are both open communities, well suited for cultural heritage fields, there are n o direct fees, of course, you certainly do sustain that system, which is not free, and highly flexible. And just at the end, you see that there are also quite a few institutions that have implemented both approaches of IIIF, and ARKs. I'll put the link later in the chat. But what's interesting here is just to finis h with this snippet, which is an  arc within an ARK iedntified resource. So that was, yeah, I'm looking forward for discussion with discussion.

Frances Madden  
That's great. Thanks, Julian, I'm going to hand over to Anne at this point, who's going to take the discussion.
