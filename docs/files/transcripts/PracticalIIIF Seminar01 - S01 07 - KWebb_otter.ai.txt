I'm Keats Webb. I'm an imaging scientist at the Smithsonian's Museum Conservation Institute and the Smithsonian is the world's largest museum, education, and research complex and that includes 19 museums in the National Zoo and I bring that up because the museum conservation institute works with all of those museums and even the zoo. So MCI is a centre for specialised technical collection research and conservation for all business collections, and the museums and so for some cases for those Smithsonian collections, it's the only Smithsonian resource for technical studies and scientific analysis and so we provide unique analytical capabilities for Smithsonian researchers. And so as a part of that we have, I do imaging, and I use a range of imaging techniques to support Conservation and Research, on those collections and so that ranges from 2D imaging, 2.5D imaging, reflectance, transformation imaging, 3D imaging, which is mostly image based 3D reconstruction, and then also some broadband spectral techniques. So reflective infrared imaging and red reflectography moving images and use physical methods, techniques like that and some narrowband kind of multispectral imaging techniques but also digital X-radiography. So in the imaging projects with the Smithsonian collections, I am collaborating with conservators and curators and researchers. And so, imaging registration is a part of that both in terms of the processing and also the visualisation, so we're using image registration for stitching image tiles together which we've seen examples of, and that's to look at regions of interest, or to look at larger objects or needing higher resolution details of, so for example infared reflectografy we have a specialised camera that has an indium gallium arsenide sensor. Um, but the spatial resolution of that sensor is 320 by 256 pixels. So in order to resolve any sort of detail, you have to take multiple images either of an area or a whole lot of images of the entire surface in order to be able to do much of anything like that. Andrew Bruce provided examples of digital X-rays, or x-radiography, our imaging plates are 14 by 17 inches, which works for some objects, but there's also plenty of objects that are larger than that, so we're using stitching in order to create composite images of those. In addition to that, we're also using layering, so the different imaging results putting those in a layered files, which we've also seen examples of, um, in order to look at those differences between the images. A lot of this is more kind of visual and qualitative. I'm using Adobe Photoshop or in paint.net because it's something that I have access to and it's what my collaborate, collaborators have access to. And so you can look at those images, turning layers on and off changing opacity, and then in addition to those examples also doing some processing so false colour infrared imaging, and also some image math looking at the differences between images so those are some of the examples of how we're using Image registration at MCI.
