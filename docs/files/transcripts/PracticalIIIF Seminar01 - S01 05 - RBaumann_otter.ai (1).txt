My name is Ryan Baumann, I'm a digital humanities developer at the Duke Library for classics computing. My work involves a lot of work with multispectral imaging of manuscript images, and also registration problems that we come into there: so registering the multispectral images to natural light images, or just other images taken of manuscripts at a different time to track how ink is degrading, things like that as well as with low light images for items in our Special Collections at Duke libraries. A lot of times we'll have a like thin LED sheet that we'll place between pages or sheets or something to try and get a transmitted light image that we want to register to a natural light. Some of the other things I've been involved with for image registration, let's give background on like problems that I think about for image registration. I was involved with a project working on imaging, carbonise high risk scrolls, to try to obtain the text so we've worked with CT scanning, micro-CT scanning doing both mosaicking and registering across different scan sessions, so that's a lot of 3D registration, registering CT scans to three service models as well. Registering multiple service models, interested in and also at Duke. We do a lot of other work with papyri we run a site called papyrii.info so, that has a lot of images of papyrii and active. We also have a large collection of papyrii our in our special collections that we're looking at re-imaging. And along with those we have images from other, other times, that we want register across time in order to compare images. And also with papyrii where you have, in some cases, papyrii that are split across collections, it's also interesting in some cases to be able to register, high-res fragments together that are, that the same text is split across multiple collections. So that's kind of my background, what I'm interested in with image registation both the multimodal and like  dichronic aspects of image registration for Special Collections objects, mainly.
