Okay so. Good afternoon, evening, good morning. We've got quite a spread of people today, so we're going to get started as we do have quite a bit to get through today. And I would like to welcome you all to our first seminar, but our third virtual event of the practical IIIF Foundation project, which is part of the Towards a National Collection Programme funded in the UK, looking at developing a number of issues to do with research involves with building a national collection in the UK. Today's seminar is going to be on Image Registration. If you've go back to the previous slide there for a second. We have quite a wide range of people who have signed up today: across America, South America, Europe, most of Europe, and then few across spread throughout and New Zealand there; so welcome, everybody. Thank you very much for signing up. If you want to go to the next one please. Okay, so the seminar today is on Image Registration. I'm not going to speak too long  to allow all of our panellists to speak. We are looking to get a brief introduction from each of our speakers. This is probably going to range from 'Hello my name is' to 'Here's some more complex things that we've been working on', but generally they're all going to be below three minutes, so we're going to be trying to be quite quick with that so it will be shorter. And then we'll get on to our topic of discussion. So, effectively as you can see here on the slide we have three main questions to be addressing today: Why do we want to register, images, how should we go about doing image registration? And is it good enough? And what is appropriate for different sort of user applications? And finally, more submissions along the lines of, how would we like to accomplish Image registration in the future? Sorry. This seminar is part of our IIIF project, Practical Applications and IIIF looking at the International Image Interoperability Framework, which, if any of you are not aware of, I would encourage you to go look at.  The website iiif.io, So it's quite easy to find but some of the discussions may also be around how IIIF will help presentations of registered images, or even carrying out registration on the fly. So I'm going to hand over to our first panellist if you'd like to get the next slide.
